Threepio,Did you hear that?  They've shut down the main reactor.  We'll be destroyed for sure.  This is madness!,4,1
Threepio,We're doomed!,4,2
Threepio,There'll be no escape for the Princess this time.,4,3
Threepio,What's that?,4,4
Threepio,I should have known better than to trust the logic of a half-sized thermocapsulary dehousing assister...,4,5
Luke,Hurry up!  Come with me!  What are you waiting for?!  Get in gear!,4,6
Threepio,"Artoo! Artoo-Detoo, where are you?",4,7
Threepio,At last!  Where have you been?,4,8
Threepio,They're heading in this direction. What are we going to do?  We'll be sent to the spice mines of Kessel or smashed into who knows what!,4,9
Threepio,"Wait a minute, where are you going?",4,10
Imperial Officer,The Death Star plans are not in the main computer.,4,11
Vader,Where are those transmissions you intercepted?,4,12
Rebel Officer,We intercepted no transmissions. Aaah...  This is a consular ship. Were on a diplomatic mission.,4,13
Vader,If this is a consular ship... where is the Ambassador?,4,14
Vader,"Commander, tear this ship apart until you've found those plans and bring me the Ambassador.  I want her alive!",4,15
Trooper,There she is! Set for stun!,4,16
Trooper,She'll be all right. Inform Lord Vader we have a prisoner.,4,17
Threepio,"Hey, you're not permitted in there.  It's restricted. You'll be deactivated for sure..",4,18
Threepio,"Don't call me a mindless philosopher, you overweight glob of grease!  Now come out before somebody sees you.",4,19
Threepio,Secret mission?  What plans?  What are you talking about?  I'm not getting in there!,4,20
Threepio,I'm going to regret this.,4,21
Chief Pilot,There goes another one.,4,22
Captain,Hold your fire.  There are no life forms.  It must have been short-circuited.,4,23
Threepio,"That's funny, the damage doesn't look as bad from out here.",4,24
Threepio,Are you sure this things safe?,4,25
Woman,I've told you kids to slow down!,4,26
Fixer,Did I hear a young noise blast through here?,4,27
Camie,It was just Wormie on another rampage.,4,28
Luke,Shape it up you guys!...  Biggs?,4,29
Luke,I didn't know you were back!  When did you get in?,4,30
Biggs,"Just now.  I wanted to surprise you, hot shot.  I thought you'd be here... certainly didn't expect you to be out working. ",4,31
Luke,"The Academy didn't change you much... but you're back so soon?  Hey, what happened, didn't you get your commission?",4,32
Biggs,Of course I got it.  Signed aboard The Rand Ecliptic last week.  First mate Biggs Darklighter at your service...... I just came back to say goodbye to all you unfortunate landlocked simpletons.,4,33
Luke,I almost forgot.  There's a battle going on!  Right here in our system.  Come and look!,4,34
Deak,Not again!  Forget it.,4,35
Luke,There they are!,4,36
Biggs,"That's no battle, hot shot... they're just sitting there!  Probably a freighter-tanker refueling.",4,37
Luke,But there was a lot of firing earlier...,4,38
Luke,"Hey, easy with those...",4,39
Camie,"Don't worry about it, Wormie.",4,40
Fixer,"I keep telling you, the Rebellion is a long way from here.  I doubt if the Empire would even fight to keep this system.  Believe me Luke, this planet is a big hunk of nothing...",4,41
Leia,"Lord Vader, I should have known.  Only you could be so bold.  The Imperial Senate will not sit stillfor this, when they hear you've attacked a diplomatic...",4,42
Vader,"Don't play games with me, Your Highness.  You weren't on any mercy mission this time.  You passed directly through a restricted system.  Several transmissions were beamed to this ship by Rebel spies.  I want to know what happened to the plans they sent you.",4,43
Leia,I don't know what you're talking about.  I'm a member of the Imperial Senate on a diplomatic mission to Alderaan...,4,44
Vader,You're a part of the Rebel Alliance... and a traitor.  Take her away!,4,45
Commander,"Holding her is dangerous.  If word of this gets out, it could generate sympathy for the Rebellion in the senate.",4,46
Vader,I have traced the Rebel spies to her.  Now she is my only link to find their secret base!,4,47
Commander,you anything.,4,48
Vader,Leave that to me.  Send a distress signal and then inform the senate that all aboard were killed!,4,49
Second Officer,"Lord Vader, the battle station plans are not aboard this ship!  And no transmissions were made.  An escape pod was jettisoned during the fighting, but no life forms were aboard.",4,50
Vader,"She must have hidden the plans in the escape pod.  Send a detachment down to retrieve them.  See to it personally, Commander.  There'll be no one to stop us this time.",4,51
Commander,"Yes, sir.",4,52
Threepio,How did I get into this mess?  I really don't know how.  We seem to be made to suffer.  It's our lot in life.,4,53
Threepio,I've got to rest before I fall apart.  My joints are almost frozen. ,4,54
Threepio,What a desolate place this is.,4,55
Threepio,Where are you going?,4,56
Threepio,"Well, I'm not going that way.  It's much too rocky.  This way is much easier.",4,57
Threepio,What makes you think there are settlements over there?,4,58
Threepio,Don't get technical with me.,4,59
Threepio,"What mission?  What are you talking about?  I've had just about enough of you!  Go that way!  You'll be malfunctioning within a day, you nearsighted scrap pile!",4,60
Threepio,"And don't let me catch you following me begging for help, because you won't get it.",4,61
Threepio,No more adventures.  I'm not going that way.,4,62
Threepio,"That malfunctioning little twerp.  This is all his fault!  He tricked me into going this way, but he'll do no better.",4,63
Threepio,"Wait, what's that?  A transport!  I'm saved!",4,64
Threepio,"Over here!  Help!  Please, help!",4,65
Luke,"... so I cut off my power, shut down the afterburners and came in low on Deak's trail.  I was so close I thought I was going to fry my instruments. As it was I busted up the Skyhopper pretty bad.  Uncle Owen was pretty upset.  He grounded me for the rest of the season.  You should have been there... it was fantastic.",4,66
Biggs,"You ought to take it a little easy Luke.  You may be the hottest bushpilot this side of Mos Eisley, but those little Skyhoppers are dangerous.  Keep it up, and one day, whammo, you're going to be nothing more than a dark spot on the down side of a canyon wall.",4,67
Luke,Look who's talking.  Now that you've been around those giant starships you're beginning to sound like my uncle. You've gotten soft in the city...,4,68
Biggs,I've missed you kid.,4,69
Luke,"Well, things haven't been the same since you left, Biggs.  It's been so...quiet.",4,70
Biggs,"Luke, I didn't come back just to say goodbye...  I shouldn't tell you this, but you're the only one I can trust... and if I don't come back, I want somebody to know.",4,71
Luke,What are you talking about?,4,72
Biggs,"I made some friends at the Academy. ... when our frigate goes to one of the central systems, we're going to jump ship and join the Alliance...",4,73
Luke,Join the Rebellion?!  Are you kidding!  How?,4,74
Biggs,Quiet down will ya!  You got a mouth bigger than a meteor crater!,4,75
Luke,I'm sorry.  I'm quiet. Listen how quiet I am.  You can barely hear me...,4,76
Biggs,My friend has a friend on Bestine who might help us make contact.,4,77
Luke,around forever trying to find them.,4,78
Biggs,"I know it's a long shot, but if I don't find them I'll do what I can on my own...  It's what we always talked about.  Luke, I'm not going to wait for the Empire to draft me into service.  The Rebellion is spreading and I want to be on the right side - the side I believe in. ",4,79
Luke,And I'm stuck here...,4,80
Biggs,I thought you were going to the Academy next term.  You'll get your chance to get off this rock.,4,81
Luke,Not likely!  I had to cancel my application.  There has been a lot of unrest among the Sand People since you left... they've even raided the outskirts of Anchorhead.,4,82
Biggs,Your uncle could hold off a whole colony of Sand People with one blaster.,4,83
Luke,"I know, but he's got enough vaporators going to make the place pay off.  He needs me for just one more season.  I can't leave him now.",4,84
Biggs,"I feel for you, Luke, you're going to have to learn what seems to be important or what really is important.  What good is all your uncle's work if it's taken over by the Empire?...  You know they're starting to nationalize commerce in the central systems...it won't be long before your uncle is merely a tenant, slaving for the greater glory of the Empire.",4,85
Luke,It couldn't happen here.  You said it yourself.  The Empire won't bother with this rock.,4,86
Biggs,Things always change.,4,87
Luke,I wish I was going...  Are you going to be around long? ,4,88
Biggs,"No, I'm leaving in the morning...",4,89
Luke,Then I guess I won't see you.,4,90
Biggs,Maybe someday...  I'll keep a lookout.,4,91
Luke,"Well, I'll be at the Academy next season... after that who knows.  I won't be drafted into the Imperial Starfleet that's for sure...  Take care of yourself, you'll always be the best friend I've got.",4,92
Biggs,"So long, Luke.",4,93
Threepio,Artoo-Detoo!  It's you!  It's you!,4,94
First Trooper,Someone was in the pod.  The tracks go off in this direction. ,4,95
Second Trooper,"Look, sir - droids.",4,96
Threepio,Wake up!  Wake up!,4,97
Threepio,We're doomed.,4,98
Threepio,Do you think they'll melt us down?,4,99
Threepio,Don't shoot!  Don't shoot!  Will this never end?,4,100
Beru,"Luke, tell Owen that if he gets a translator to be sure it speaks Bocce.",4,101
Luke,It looks like we don't have much of a choice but I'll remind him.,4,102
Owen,I have no need for a protocol droid.,4,103
Threepio,Sir - not in an environment such as this - that's why I've also been programmed for over thirty secondary functions that...,4,104
Owen,What I really need is a droid that understands the binary languages of moisture vaporators.,4,105
Threepio,Vaporators!  Sir - My first job was programming binary load lifters... very similar to your vaporators.  You could say...,4,106
Owen,Do you speak Bocce?,4,107
Threepio,"Of course I can, sir.  It's like a second language for me...  I'm as fluent in Bocce...",4,108
Owen,All right; shut up! I'll take this one.,4,109
Threepio,"Shutting up, sir.",4,110
Owen,"Luke, take these two over to the garage, will you?  I want you to have both of them cleaned up before dinner.",4,111
Luke,But I was going into Toshi Station to pick up some power converters...,4,112
Owen,"You can waste time with your friends when your chores are done.  Now, come on, get to it!",4,113
Luke,"All right, come on!  And the red one, come on.  Well, come on, Red, let's go.",4,114
Luke,Uncle Owen...,4,115
Owen,Yeah?,4,116
Luke,This R2 unit has a bad motivator.  Look!,4,117
Owen,"Hey, what're you trying to push on us?",4,118
Threepio,"Excuse me, sir, but that R2 unit is in prime condition.  A real bargain.",4,119
Luke,Uncle Owen...,4,120
Owen,Yeah?,4,121
Luke,What about that one?,4,122
Owen,What about that blue one?  We'll take that one.,4,123
Luke,"Yeah, take it away.",4,124
Threepio,"Uh, I'm quite sure you'll be very pleased with that one, sir.  He really is in first-class condition.  I've worked with him before.  Here he comes.",4,125
Luke,"Okay, let's go.",4,126
Threepio,"Now, don't forget this!  Why I should stick my neck out for you is quite beyond my capacity!",4,127
Threepio,"Thank the maker!  This oil bath is going to feel so good.  I've got such a bad case of dust contamination, I can barely move!",4,128
Luke,"It just isn't fair.  Oh, Biggs is right.  I'm never gonna get out of here!",4,129
Threepio,Is there anything I might do to help? ,4,130
Luke,"Well, not unless you can alter time, speed up the harvest, or teleport me off this rock!",4,131
Threepio,"I don't think so, sir.  I'm only a droid and not very knowledgeable about such things.  Not on this planet, anyways.  As a matter of fact, I'm not even sure which planet I'm on.",4,132
Luke,"Well, if there's a bright center to the universe, you're on the planet that it's farthest from.",4,133
Threepio,"I see, sir.",4,134
Luke,"Uh, you can call me Luke.",4,135
Threepio,"I see, sir Luke.",4,136
Luke,Just Luke.,4,137
Threepio,"And I am See-Threepio, human-cyborg relations, and this is my counterpart, Artoo-Detoo.",4,138
Luke,Hello.,4,139
Luke,You got a lot of carbon scoring here.  It looks like you boys have seen a lot of action.,4,140
Threepio,"With all we've been through, sometimes I'm amazed we're in as good condition as we are, what with the Rebellion and all.",4,141
Luke,You know of the Rebellion against the Empire?,4,142
Threepio,"That's how we came to be in your service, if you take my meaning, sir.",4,143
Luke,Have you been in many battles?,4,144
Threepio,"Several, I think.  Actually, there's not much to tell.  I'm not much more than an interpreter, and not very good at telling stories.  Well, not at making them interesting, anyways.",4,145
Luke,"Well, my little friend, you've got something jammed in here real good.  Were you on a starcruiser or...",4,146
Leia,"Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi.  You'remy only hope.",4,147
Luke,What's this?,4,148
Threepio,What is what?!?  He asked you a question...What is that?,4,149
Leia,"Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi.  You're my only hope.  Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi.  You're my only hope.",4,150
Threepio,"Oh, he says it's nothing, sir.  Merely a malfunction.  Old data.  Pay it no mind.",4,151
Luke,Who is she?  She's beautiful.,4,152
Threepio,"I'm afraid I'm not quite sure, sir.",4,153
Leia,"Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi...",4,154
Threepio,"I think she was a passenger on our last voyage.  A person of some importance, sir - I believe.  Our captain was attached to...",4,155
Luke,Is there more to this recording?,4,156
Threepio,"Behave yourself, Artoo.  You're going to get us in trouble.  It's all right, you can trust him.  He's our new master.",4,157
Threepio,"He says he's the property of Obi-Wan Kenobi, a resident of these parts.  And it's a private message for him.  Quite frankly, sir, I don't know what he's talking about.  Our last master was Captain Antilles, but with what we've been through, this little R2 unit has become a bit eccentric.",4,158
Luke,Obi-Wan Kenobi?  I wonder if he means old Ben Kenobi?,4,159
Threepio,"I beg your pardon, sir, but do you know what he's talking about?",4,160
Luke,"Well, I don't know anyone named Obi-Wan, but old Ben lives out beyond the dune sea.  He's kind of a strange old hermit.",4,161
Luke,I wonder who she is.  It sounds like she's in trouble.  I'd better play back the whole thing.,4,162
Threepio,"He says the restraining bolt has short circuited his recording system.  He suggests that if you remove the bolt, he might be able to play back the entire recording.",4,163
Luke,"H'm?  Oh, yeah, well, I guess you're too small to run away on me if I take this off!  Okay.",4,164
Luke,There you go.,4,165
Luke,"Well, wait a minute.  Where'd she go?  Bring her back!  Play back the entire message.",4,166
Threepio,been playing.  The one you're carrying inside your rusty innards! ,4,167
Aunt Beru,Luke?  Luke!  Come to dinner!,4,168
Luke,"All right, I'll be right there, Aunt Beru.",4,169
Threepio,"I'm sorry, sir, but he appears to have picked up a slight flutter.",4,170
Luke,"Well, see what you can do with him.  I'll be right back.",4,171
Threepio,Just you reconsider playing that message for him.,4,172
Threepio,"No, I don't think he likes you at all.",4,173
Threepio,"No, I don't like you either.",4,174
Luke,"You know, I think that R2 unit we bought might have been stolen.",4,175
Owen,What makes you think that?,4,176
Luke,"Well, I stumbled across a recording while I was cleaning him.  He says he belongs to someone called Obi-Wan Kenobi.",4,177
Luke,"I thought he might have meant Ben.  Do you know what he's talking about?  Well, I wonder if he's related to Ben.",4,178
Owen,That old man's just a crazy wizard.  Tomorrow I want you to take that R2 unit into Anchorhead and have its memory flushed.  That'll be the end of it.  It belongs to us now.,4,179
Luke,But what if this Obi-Wan comes looking for him?,4,180
Owen,"He won't, I don't think he exists any more.  He died about the same time as your father.",4,181
Luke,He knew my father?,4,182
Owen,I told you to forget it.  Your only concern is to prepare the new droids for tomorrow.  In the morning I want them on the south ridge working out those condensers.,4,183
Luke,"Yes, sir.  I think those new droids are going to work out fine.  In fact, I, uh, was also thinking about our agreement about my staying on another season.  And if these new droids do work out, I want to transmit my application to the Academy this year.",4,184
Owen,You mean the next semester before harvest?,4,185
Luke,"Sure, there're more than enough droids.",4,186
Owen,Harvest is when I need you the most.  Only one more season.  This year we'll make enough on the harvest so I'll be able to hire some more hands.  And then you can go to the Academy next year.,4,187
Owen,"You must understand I need you here, Luke.",4,188
Luke,But it's a whole 'nother year.,4,189
Owen,"Look, it's only one more season.",4,190
Luke,"Yeah, that's what you said last year when Biggs and Tank left.",4,191
Aunt Beru,Where are you going?,4,192
Luke,It looks like I'm going nowhere.  I have to finish cleaning those droids.,4,193
Aunt Beru,"Owen, he can't stay here forever.  Most of his friends have gone.  It means so much to him.",4,194
Owen,I'll make it up to him next year.  I promise.,4,195
Aunt Beru,"Luke's just not a farmer, Owen.  He has too much of his father in him.",4,196
Owen,That's what I'm afraid of.,4,197
Luke,What are you doing hiding there?,4,198
Threepio,"It wasn't my fault, sir.  Please don't deactivate me.  I told him not to go, but he's faulty, malfunctioning; kept babbling on about his mission.",4,199
Luke,"Oh, no!",4,200
Threepio,That R2 unit has always been a problem.  These astro-droids are getting quite out of hand.  Even I can't understand their logic at times. ,4,201
Luke,How could I be so stupid?  He's nowhere in sight.  Blast it!,4,202
Threepio,"Pardon me, sir, but couldn't we go after him?",4,203
Luke,It's too dangerous with all the Sand People around.  We'll have to wait until morning.,4,204
Owen,"Luke, I'm shutting the power down for the night.",4,205
Luke,"All right, I'll be there in a few minutes.  Boy, am I gonna get it.",4,206
Luke,You know that little droid is going to cause me a lot of trouble.,4,207
Threepio,"Oh, he excels at that, sir.",4,208
Owen,Luke?  Luke?  Luke?  Where could he be loafing now!,4,209
Owen,Have you seen Luke this morning?,4,210
Aunt Beru,"He said he had some things to do before he started today, so he left early.",4,211
Owen,Uh?  Did he take those two new droids with him?,4,212
Aunt Beru,I think so.,4,213
Owen,"Well, he'd better have those units in the south range repaired bemidday or there'll be hell to pay!",4,214
Luke,How's that.,4,215
Luke,"Old Ben Kenobi lives out in this direction somewhere, but I don't see how that R2 unit could have come this far.  We must have missed him.  Uncle Owen isn't going to take this very well.",4,216
Threepio,"Sir, would it help if you told him it was my fault.",4,217
Luke,Sure.  He needs you.  He'd probably only deactivate you for a day or so...,4,218
Threepio,"Deactivate!  Well, on the other hand if you hadn't removed his restraining bolt...",4,219
Luke,"Wait, there's something dead ahead on the scanner.  It looks like our droid... hit the accelerator.",4,220
Luke,"Hey, whoa, just where do you think you're going?",4,221
Threepio,"Master Luke here is your rightful owner.  We'll have no more of this Obi-Wan Kenobi jibberish... and don't talk to me of your mission, either.  You're fortunate he doesn't blast you into a million pieces right here.",4,222
Luke,"Well, come on. It's getting late.  I only hope we can get back before Uncle Owen really blows up.",4,223
Threepio,"If you don't mind my saying so, sir, I think you should deactivate the little fugitive until you've gotten him back to your workshop.",4,224
Luke,"No, he's not going to try anything.",4,225
Luke,What's wrong with him now?,4,226
Threepio,"Oh my... sir, he says there are several creatures approaching from the southeast.",4,227
Luke,"Sand People!  Or worse!  Come on, let's have a look.  Come on.",4,228
Luke,"There are two Banthas down there but I don't see any... wait a second, they're Sand People all right.  I can see one of them now.",4,229
Ben,Hello there!  Come here my little friend.  Don't be afraid.,4,230
Ben,"Don't worry, he'll be all right.",4,231
Luke,What happened?,4,232
Ben,"Rest easy, son, you've had a busy day.  You're fortunate you're still in one piece.",4,233
Luke,"Ben?  Ben Kenobi!  Boy, am I glad to see you! ",4,234
Ben,"The Jundland Wastes are not to be traveled lightly.  Tell me, young Luke, what brings you out this far?",4,235
Luke,"Oh, this little droid!  I think he's searching for his former master...  I've never seen such devotion in a droid before... there seems tobe no stopping him.  He claims to be the property of an Obi-Wan Kenobi.  Is he a relative of yours?  Do you know who he's talking about?",4,236
Ben,Obi-Wan Kenobi... Obi-Wan?  Now thats a name I haven't heard in a long time... a long time.,4,237
Luke,I think my uncle knew him.  He said he was dead.,4,238
Ben,"Oh, he's not dead, no... not yet.",4,239
Luke,You know him!,4,240
Ben,"Well of course, of course I know him.  He's me!  I haven't gone by the name Obi-Wan since oh, before you were born.",4,241
Luke,Then the droid does belong to you.,4,242
Ben,Don't seem to remember ever owning a droid.  Very interesting... ,4,243
Ben,I think we better get indoors.  The Sand People are easily startled but they will soon be back and in greater numbers.,4,244
Luke,... Threepio!,4,245
Threepio,Where am I?  I must have taken a bad step...,4,246
Luke,Can you stand?  We've got to get out of here before the Sand People return.,4,247
Threepio,"I don't think I can make it.  You go on, Master Luke.  There's no sense in you risking yourself on my account.  I'm done for.",4,248
Luke,"No, you're not.  What kind of talk is that?",4,249
Ben,"Quickly, son... they're on the move.",4,250
Luke,"No, my father didn't fight in the wars.  He was a navigator on a spice freighter.",4,251
Ben,That's what your uncle told you.  He didn't hold with your father's ideals.  Thought he should have stayed here and not gotten involved.,4,252
Luke,You fought in the Clone Wars?,4,253
Ben,"Yes, I was once a Jedi Knight the same as your father.",4,254
Luke,I wish I'd known him.,4,255
Ben,"He was the best star-pilot in the galaxy, and a cunning warrior.  I understand you've become quite a good pilot yourself.  And he was a good friend.  Which reminds me...",4,256
Ben,"I have something here for you.  Your father wanted you to have this when you were old enough, but your uncle wouldn't allow it.  He feared you might follow old Obi-Wan on some damned-fool idealistic crusade like your father did. ",4,257
Threepio,"Sir, if you'll not be needing me, I'll close down for awhile.",4,258
Luke,"Sure, go ahead.",4,259
Luke,What is it?,4,260
Ben,Your fathers lightsaber.  This is the weapon of a Jedi Knight.  Not as clumsy or as random as a blaster.,4,261
Ben,"An elegant weapon for a morecivilized time.  For over a thousand generations the Jedi Knights were the guardians of peace and justice in the Old Republic.  Before the dark times, before the Empire.",4,262
Luke,How did my father die?,4,263
Ben,"A young Jedi named Darth Vader, who was a pupil of mine until he turned to evil, helped the Empire hunt down and destroy the Jedi Knights.  He betrayed and murdered your father.  Now the Jedi are all but extinct.  Vader was seduced by the dark side of the Force.",4,264
Luke,The Force?,4,265
Ben,"Well, the Force is what gives the Jedi his power.  It's an energy field created by all living things.  It surrounds us and penetrates us.  It binds the galaxy together.",4,266
Ben,"Now, let's see if we can't figure out what you are, my little friend.  And where you come from.",4,267
Luke,I saw part of the message he was...,4,268
Ben,I seem to have found it.,4,269
Leia,"General Kenobi, years ago you served my father in the Clone Wars.  Now he begs you to help him in his struggle against the Empire.  I regret that I am unable to present my father's request to you in person, but my ship has fallen under attack and I'm afraid my mission to bring you to Alderaan has failed.  I have placed information vital to the survival of the Rebellion into the memory systems of this R2 unit.  My father will know how to retrieve it.  You must see this droid safely delivered to him on Alderaan.  This is our most desperate hour.  Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi, you're my only hope.",4,270
Ben,You must learn the ways of the Force if you're to come with me to Alderaan.,4,271
Luke,"Alderaan?  I'm not going to Alderaan.  I've got to go home.  It's late, I'm in for it as it is.",4,272
Ben,"I need your help, Luke.  I'm getting too old for this sort of thing.She needs your help.",4,273
Luke,I can't get involved!  I've got work to do!  It's not that I like the Empire.  I hate it!  But there's nothing I can do about it right now.  It's such a long way from here.,4,274
Ben,That's your uncle talking.,4,275
Luke,"Oh, God, my uncle.  How am I ever going to explain this?",4,276
Ben,"Learn about the Force, Luke.",4,277
Luke,"Look, I can take you as far as Anchorhead.  You can get a transport there to Mos Eisley or wherever you're going.",4,278
Ben,"You must do what you feel is right, of course.",4,279
Tagge,Until this battle station is fully operational we are vulnerable.  The Rebel Alliance is too well equipped.  They're more dangerous than you realize.,4,280
Motti,"Dangerous to your starfleet, Commander; not to this battle station!",4,281
Tagge,The Rebellion will continue to gain support in the Imperial Senate as long as....,4,282
Tarkin,The Imperial Senate will no longer be of any concern to us.  I've just received word that the Emperor has dissolved the council permanently.  The last remnants of the Old Republic have been swept away.,4,283
Tagge,That's impossible!  How will the Emperor maintain control without the bureaucracy?,4,284
Tarkin,The regional governors now have direct control over territories.  Fear will keep the local systems in line.  Fear of this battle station.,4,285
Tagge,"And what of the Rebellion?  If the Rebels have obtained a complete technical readout of this station, it is possible, however unlikely, that they might find a weakness and exploit it.",4,286
Vader,The plans you refer to will soon be back in our hands.,4,287
Motti,"Any attack made by the Rebels against this station would be a useless gesture, no matter what technical data they've obtained.  This station is now the ultimate power in the universe.  I suggest we use it!",4,288
Vader,Don't be too proud of this technological terror you've constructed.  The ability to destroy a planet is insignificant next to the power of the Force.,4,289
Motti,"Don't try to frighten us with your sorcerer's ways, Lord Vader.  Your sad devotion to that ancient religion has not helped you conjure up the stolen data tapes, or given you clairvoyance enough to find the Rebel's hidden fort...",4,290
Vader,I find your lack of faith disturbing.,4,291
Tarkin,"Enough of this!  Vader, release him!",4,292
Vader,As you wish.,4,293
Tarkin,This bickering is pointless.  Lord Vader will provide us with the location of the Rebel fortress by the time this station is operational.  We will then crush the Rebellion with one swift stroke.,4,294
Luke,"It looks like Sand People did this, all right.  Look, here are gaffi sticks, bantha tracks.  It's just... I never heard of them hitting anything this big before.",4,295
Ben,They didn't.  But we are meant to think they did.  These tracks are side by side.  Sand People always ride single file to hide there numbers.,4,296
Luke,These are the same Jawas that sold us Artoo and Threepio.,4,297
Ben,"And these blast points, too accurate for Sand People.  Only Imperial stormtroopers are so precise.",4,298
Luke,Why would Imperial troops want to slaughter Jawas?,4,299
Luke,"If they traced the robots here, they may have learned who they sold them to.  And that would lead them back home!",4,300
Ben,"Wait, Luke!  It's too dangerous.",4,301
Luke,Uncle Owen!  Aunt Beru!  Uncle Owen!,4,302
Vader,"And, now Your Highness, we will discuss the location of your hidden Rebel base.",4,303
Ben,"There's nothing you could have done, Luke, had you been there.  You'd have been killed, too, and the droids would now be in the hands of the Empire.",4,304
Luke,I want to come with you to Alderaan.  There's nothing here for me now.  I want to learn the ways of the Force and become a Jedi like my father.,4,305
Ben,Mos Eisley Spaceport.  You will never find a more wretched hive of scum and villainy.  We must be cautious.,4,306
Trooper,How long have you had these droids?,4,307
Luke,About three or four seasons.,4,308
Ben,They're for sale if you want them.,4,309
Trooper,Let me see your identification.,4,310
Ben,You don't need to see his identification.,4,311
Trooper,We don't need to see his identification.,4,312
Ben,looking for.,4,313
Trooper,These are not the droids we're looking for.,4,314
Ben,He can go about his business.,4,315
Trooper,You can go about your business.,4,316
Ben,Move along.,4,317
Trooper,Move along.  Move along.,4,318
Threepio,I can't abide these Jawas.  Disgusting creatures.,4,319
Luke,"Go on, go on.  I can't understand how we got by those troopers.  I thought we were dead.",4,320
Ben,The Force can have a strong influence on the weak-minded.  You will find it a powerful ally.,4,321
Luke,Do you really think we're going to find a pilot here that'll take us to Alderaan?,4,322
Ben,"Well, most of the best freighter pilots can be found here.  Only watch your step.  This place can be a little rough.",4,323
Luke,I'm ready for anything.,4,324
Threepio,"Come along, Artoo.",4,325
Bartender,We don't serve their kind here!,4,326
Luke,What?,4,327
Bartender,Your droids. They'll have to wait outside.  We don't want them here.,4,328
Luke,"Listen, why don't you wait out by the speeder.  We don't want any trouble.",4,329
Threepio,I heartily agree with you sir.,4,330
Creature,Negola dewaghi wooldugger?!?,4,331
Human,He doesn't like you.,4,332
Luke,I'm sorry.,4,333
Human,I don't like you either,4,334
Human,Don't insult us.  You just watch yourself.  We're wanted men.  I have the death sentence on twelve systems.,4,335
Luke,I'll be careful than.,4,336
Human,You'll be dead.,4,337
Ben,This little one isn't worth the effort.  Come let me buy you something...,4,338
Bartender,No blasters!  No blaster!,4,339
Ben,This is Chewbacca.  He's first-mate on a ship that might suit our needs.,4,340
Threepio,I don't like the look of this.,4,341
Han,Han Solo.  I'm captain of the Millennium Falcon.  Chewie here tells me you're looking for passage to the Alderaan system.,4,342
Ben,"Yes, indeed.  If it's a fast ship.",4,343
Han,Fast ship?  You've never heard of the Millennium Falcon?,4,344
Ben,Should I have?,4,345
Han,It's the ship that made the Kessel run in less than twelve parsecs!,4,346
Han,"I've outrun Imperial starships, not the local bulk-cruisers, mind you.  I'm talking about the big Corellian ships now.  She's fast enough for you, old man.  What's the cargo?",4,347
Ben,"Only passengers.  Myself, the boy, two droids, and no questions asked.",4,348
Han,What is it?  Some kind of local trouble?,4,349
Ben,Let's just say we'd like to avoid any Imperial entanglements.,4,350
Han,"Well, that's the real trick, isn't it?  And it's going to cost you something extra.  Ten thousand in advance.",4,351
Luke,Ten thousand?  We could almost buy our own ship for that!,4,352
Han,"But who's going to fly it, kid!  You?",4,353
Luke,You bet I could.  I'm not such a bad pilot myself!  We don't have to sit here and listen...,4,354
Ben,"We haven't that much with us.  But we could pay you two thousand now, plus fifteen when we reach Alderaan.",4,355
Han,"Seventeen, huh!",4,356
Han,Okay.  You guys got yourself a ship.  We'll leave as soon as you're ready.  Docking bay Ninety-four.,4,357
Ben,Ninety-four.,4,358
Han,Looks like somebody's beginning to take an interest in your handiwork.,4,359
Trooper,"All right, we'll check it out.",4,360
Han,Seventeen thousand!  Those guys must really be desperate.  This could really save my neck.  Get back to the ship and get her ready.,4,361
Ben,You'll have to sell your speeder.,4,362
Luke,That's okay.  I'm never coming back to this planet again.,4,363
Greedo,"Going somewhere, Solo?",4,364
Han,"Yes, Greedo.  As a matter of fact, I was just going to see your boss.  Tell Jabba that I've got his money.",4,365
Greedo,"It's too late.  You should have paid him when you had the chance.  Jabba's put a price on your head, so large that every bounty hunter in the galaxy will be looking for you.  I'm lucky I found you first.",4,366
Han,"Yeah, but this time I got the money.",4,367
Greedo,"If you give it to me, I might forget I found you.",4,368
Han,I don't have it with me.  Tell Jabba...,4,369
Greedo,Jabba's through with you.  He has no time for smugglers who drop their shipments at the first sign of an Imperial cruiser.,4,370
Han,Even I get boarded sometimes.  Do you think I had a choice?,4,371
Greedo,You can tell that to Jabba.  He may only take your ship.,4,372
Han,Over my dead body.,4,373
Greedo,That's the idea I've been looking forward to killing you for a long time.,4,374
Han,"Yes, I'll bet you have.",4,375
Han,Sorry about the mess.,4,376
Vader,Her resistance to the mind probe is considerable.  It will be some time before we can extract any information from her.,4,377
Imperial Officer,The final check-out is complete.  All systems are operational.  What course shall we set?,4,378
Tarkin,Perhaps she would respond to an alternative form of persuasion.,4,379
Vader,What do you mean?,4,380
Tarkin,I think it is time we demonstrate the full power of this station.Set your course for Princess Leia's home planet of Alderaan.,4,381
Trooper,With pleasure.,4,382
Threepio,"Lock the door, Artoo.",4,383
Trooper,"All right, check that side of the street.  It's secure.  Move on to the next door.",4,384
Threepio,"I would much rather have gone with Master Luke than stay here with you.  I don't know what all this trouble is about, but I'm sure it must be your fault.",4,385
Threepio,You watch your language!,4,386
Luke,"He says it's the best he can do.  Since the XP-38 came out, they ",4,387
Ben,It will be enough.,4,388
Ben,"If the ship's as fast as he's boasting, we ought to do well.",4,389
Jabba,"Come on out, Solo!",4,390
Han,"I've been waiting for you, Jabba.",4,391
Jabba,I expected you would be.,4,392
Han,I'm not the type to run.,4,393
Jabba,"Han, my boy, there are times when you disappoint me... why haven't you paid me?  And why did you have to fry poor Greedo like that... after all we've been through together.",4,394
Han,You sent Greedo to blast me.,4,395
Jabba,"Han, why you're the best smuggler in the business.  You're too valuable to fry.  He was only relaying my concern at your delays.  He wasn't going to blast you.",4,396
Han,"I think he thought he was.  Next time don't send one of those twerps.  If you've got something to say to me, come see me yourself.",4,397
Jabba,"Han, Han!  If only you hadn't had to dump that shipment of spice... you understand I just can't make an exception.  Where would I be if every pilot who smuggled for me dumped their shipment at the first sign of an Imperial starship?  It's not good business.",4,398
Han,"You know, even I get boarded sometimes, Jabba.  I had no choice, but I've gota charter now and I can pay you back, plus a little extra.  I just need some more time.",4,399
Jabba,"Put your blasters away.  Han, my boy, I'm only doing this because you're the best and I need you.  So, for an extra, say... twenty percent I'll give you a little more time... but this is it.  If you disappoint me again, I'll put a price on your head so large you won't be able to go near a civilized system for the rest of your short life.",4,400
Han,"Jabba, I'll pay you because it's my pleasure.",4,401
Luke,What a piece of junk.,4,402
Han,"She'll make point five beyond the speed of light.  She may not look like much, but she's got it where it counts, kid.  I've added some special modifications myself.",4,403
Han,"We're a little rushed, so if you'll hurry aboard we'll get out of here.",4,404
Threepio,"Hello, sir.",4,405
Trooper,Which way?,4,406
Trooper,"All right, men.  Load your weapons!",4,407
Trooper,Stop that ship!,4,408
Trooper,Blast 'em!,4,409
Han,"Chewie, get us out of here!",4,410
Threepio,"Oh, my.  I'd forgotten how much I hate space travel.",4,411
Han,It looks like an Imperial cruiser.  Our passengers must be hotter than I thought.  Try and hold them off.  Angle the deflector shield while I make the calculations for the jump to light speed.,4,412
Han,Stay sharp!  There are two more coming in; they're going to try to cut us off.,4,413
Luke,Why don't you outrun them?  I thought you said this thing was fast.,4,414
Han,"Watch your mouth, kid, or you're going to find yourself floating home.  We'll be safe enough once we make the jump to hyperspace.  Besides, I know a few maneuvers. We'll lose them!",4,415
Han,Here's where the fun begins!,4,416
Ben,How long before you can make the jump to light speed?,4,417
Han,It'll take a few moments to get the coordinates from the navi-computer.,4,418
Luke,Are you kidding?  At the rate they're gaining...,4,419
Han,"Traveling through hyperspace isn't like dusting crops, boy!  Without precise calculations we could fly right through a star or bounce too close to a supernova and that'd end your trip real quick, wouldn't it?",4,420
Luke,What's that flashing?,4,421
Han,"We're losing our deflector shield.  Go strap yourself in, I'm going to make the jump to light speed.",4,422
Motti,We've entered the Alderaan system.,4,423
Leia,"Governor Tarkin, I should have expected to find you holding Vader's leash.  I recognized your foul stench when I was brought on board.",4,424
Tarkin,Charming to the last.  You don't know how hard I found it signing the order to terminate your life!,4,425
Leia,to take the responsibility yourself!,4,426
Tarkin,"Princess Leia, before your execution I would like you to be my guest at a ceremony that will make this battle station operational.  No star system will dare oppose the Emperor now.",4,427
Leia,"The more you tighten your grip, Tarkin, the more star systems will slip through your fingers.",4,428
Tarkin,"Not after we demonstrate the power of this station.  In a way, you have determined the choice of the planet that'll be destroyed first.  Since you are reluctant to provide us with the location of the Rebel base, I have chosen to test this station's destructive power... on your home planet of Alderaan.",4,429
Leia,No!  Alderaan is peaceful.  We have no weapons.  You can't possibly...,4,430
Tarkin,You would prefer another target?  A military target?  Then name the system!,4,431
Tarkin,I grow tired of asking this.  So it'll be the last time.  Where is the Rebel base?,4,432
Leia,Dantooine.,4,433
Leia,They're on Dantooine.,4,434
Tarkin,"There.  You see Lord Vader, she can be reasonable. Continue with the operation.  You may fire when ready.",4,435
Leia,What?,4,436
Tarkin,You're far too trusting.  Dantooine is too remote to make an effective demonstration.  But don't worry.  We will deal with your Rebel friends soon enough. ,4,437
Leia,No!,4,438
Vader,Commence primary ignition.,4,439
Luke,Are you all right?  What's wrong?,4,440
Ben,I felt a great disturbance in the Force... as if millions of voices suddenly cried out in terror and were suddenly silenced.  I fear something terrible has happened.,4,441
Ben,You'd better get on with your exercises.,4,442
Han,"Well, you can forget your troubles with those Imperial slugs.  I told you I'd outrun 'em.",4,443
Han,Don't everyone thank me at once.,4,444
Han,"Anyway, we should be at Alderaan about oh-two-hundred hours.",4,445
Threepio,"Now be careful, Artoo.",4,446
Threepio,He made a fair move.  Screaming about it won't help you.,4,447
Han,Let him have it. It's not wise to upset a Wookiee.,4,448
Threepio,"But sir, nobody worries about upsetting a droid.",4,449
Han,That's 'cause droids don't pull people's arms out of their socket when they lose.  Wookiees are known to do that.,4,450
Threepio,"I see your point, sir.  I suggest a new strategy, Artoo.  Let the Wookiee win.",4,451
Ben,"Remember, a Jedi can feel the Force flowing through him.",4,452
Luke,You mean it controls your actions?,4,453
Ben,Partially. But it also obeys your commands.,4,454
Han,"Hokey religions and ancient weapons are no match for a good blaster at your side, kid.",4,455
Luke,"You don't believe in the Force, do you?",4,456
Han,"Kid, I've flown from one side of this galaxy to the other.  I've seen a lot of strange stuff, but I've never seen anything to make me believe there's one all-powerful force controlling everything.  There's no mystical energy field that controls my destiny.",4,457
Han,It's all a lot of simple tricks and nonsense.,4,458
Ben,"I suggest you try it again, Luke.",4,459
Ben,"This time, let go your conscious self and act on instinct.",4,460
Luke,"With the blast shield down, I can't even see.  How am I supposed to fight?",4,461
Ben,Your eyes can deceive you.  Don't trust them.,4,462
Ben,Stretch out with your feelings.,4,463
Ben,"You see, you can do it.",4,464
Han,I call it luck. ,4,465
Ben,"In my experience, there's no such thing as luck.",4,466
Han,"Look, going good against remotes is one thing.  Going good against the living?  That's something else.",4,467
Han,Looks like we're coming up on Alderaan.,4,468
Luke,"You know, I did feel something.  I could almost see the remote.",4,469
Ben,That's good.  You have taken your first step into a larger world.,4,470
Tarkin,Yes.,4,471
Officer Cass,"Our scout ships have reached Dantooine.  They found the remains of a Rebel base, but they estimate that it has been deserted for some time.  They are now conducting an extensive search of the surrounding systems.",4,472
Tarkin,She lied!  She lied to us!,4,473
Vader,I told you she would never consciously betray the Rebellion.,4,474
Tarkin,Terminate her... immediately!,4,475
Han,"Stand by, Chewie, here we go.  Cut in the sublight engines.",4,476
Han,"What the...?  Aw, we've come out of hyperspace into a meteor shower.  Some kind of asteroid collision.  It's not on any of the charts.",4,477
Luke,What's going on?,4,478
Han,"Our position is correct, except... no, Alderaan!",4,479
Luke,What do you mean?  Where is it?,4,480
Han,"Thats what I'm trying to tell you, kid.  It ain't there.  It's been totally blown away.",4,481
Luke,What?  How?,4,482
Ben,Destroyed... by the Empire!,4,483
Han,The entire starfleet couldn't destroy the whole planet.  It'd take a thousand ships with more fire power than I've...,4,484
Han,There's another ship coming in.,4,485
Luke,Maybe they know what happened.,4,486
Ben,It's an Imperial fighter.,4,487
Luke,It followed us!,4,488
Ben,No.  It's a short range fighter.,4,489
Han,There aren't any bases around here.  Where did it come from?,4,490
Luke,"It sure is leaving in a big hurry.  If they identify us, we're in big trouble.",4,491
Han,Not if I can help it.  Chewie... jam it's transmissions.,4,492
Ben,It'd be as well to let it go.  It's too far out of range.,4,493
Han,Not for long...,4,494
Ben,A fighter that size couldn't get this deep into space on its own.,4,495
Luke,"Then he must have gotten lost, been part of a convoy or something...",4,496
Han,"Well, he ain't going to be around long enough to tell anyone about us.",4,497
Luke,Look at him.  He's heading for that small moon.,4,498
Han,I think I can get him before he gets there... he's almost in range.,4,499
Ben,That's no moon!  It's a space station.,4,500
Han,It's too big to be a space station.,4,501
Luke,I have a very bad feeling about this.,4,502
Ben,Turn the ship around!,4,503
Han,"Yeah, I think your right.  Full reverse!  Chewie, lock in the auxiliary power.",4,504
Luke,Why are we still moving towards it?,4,505
Han,We're caught in a tractor beam!  It's pulling us in!,4,506
Luke,But there's gotta be something you can do!,4,507
Han,"There's nothin' I can do about it, kid.  I'm in full power.  I'm going to have to shut down.  But they're not going to get me without a fight!",4,508
Ben,You can't win.  But there are alternatives to fighting.,4,509
Voice Over Death Star Intercom,Clear Bay twenty-three-seven.  We are opening the magnetic field.,4,510
Officer,To your stations!,4,511
Officer,Come with me.,4,512
Officer,Close all outboard shields!  Close all outboard shields!,4,513
Tarkin,Yes.,4,514
Voice,We've captured a freighter entering the remains of the Alderaan system.  It's markings match those of a ship that blasted its way out of Mos Eisley.,4,515
Vader,They must be trying to return the stolen plans to the princess.  She may yet be of some use to us.,4,516
Voice,Unlock one-five-seven and nine. Release charges.,4,517
Officer,"There's no one on board, sir.  According to the log, the crew abandoned ship right after takeoff.  It must be a decoy, sir.  Several of the escape pods have been jettisoned.",4,518
Vader,Did you find any droids?,4,519
Officer,"No, sir.  If there were any on board, they must also have jettisoned.",4,520
Vader,Send a scanning crew on board.  I want every part of this ship checked.,4,521
Officer,"Yes, sir.",4,522
Vader,I sense something... a presence I haven't felt since...,4,523
Officer,Get me a scanning crew in here on the double.  I want every part of this ship checked!,4,524
Luke,"Boy, it's lucky you had these compartments.",4,525
Han,"I use them for smuggling.  I never thought I'd be smuggling myself in them.  This is ridiculous.  Even if I could take off, I'd never get past the tractor beam.",4,526
Ben,Leave that to me!,4,527
Han,Damn fool. I knew that you were going to say that!,4,528
Ben,Who's the more foolish... the fool or the fool who follows him?,4,529
Trooper,"The ship's all yours.  If the scanners pick up anything, report it immediately.  All right, let's go.",4,530
Han,"Hey down there, could you give us a hand with this?",4,531
Gantry Officer,"TX-four-one-two.  Why aren't you at your post?  TX-four-one-two, do you copy? ",4,532
Gantry Officer,Take over.  We've got a bad transmitter.  I'll see what I can do.,4,533
Luke,"You know, between his howling and your blasting everything in sight, it's a wonder the whole station doesn't know we're here.",4,534
Han,Bring them on!  I prefer a straight fight to all this sneaking around.,4,535
Threepio,"We found the computer outlet, sir.",4,536
Ben,Plug in.  He should be able to interpret the entire Imperial computer network.,4,537
Threepio,He says he's found the main control to the power beam that's holding the ship here.  He'll try to make the precise location appear on the monitor.,4,538
Threepio,The tractor beam is coupled to the main reactor in seven locations.  A power loss at one of the terminals will allow the ship to leave.,4,539
Ben,I don't think you boys can help.  I must go alone.,4,540
Han,Whatever you say.  I've done more than I bargained for on this trip already.,4,541
Luke,I want to go with you.,4,542
Ben,"Be patient, Luke.  Stay and watch over the droids.",4,543
Luke,But he can...,4,544
Ben,They must be delivered safely or other star systems will suffer the same fate as Alderaan.  Your destiny lies along a different path from mine.  The Force will be with you... always!,4,545
Han,"Boy you said it, Chewie.",4,546
Han,Where did you dig up that old fossil?,4,547
Luke,Ben is a great man.,4,548
Han,"Yeah, great at getting us into trouble.",4,549
Luke,I didn't hear you give any ideas...,4,550
Han,"Well, anything would be better than just hanging around waiting for them to pick us up...",4,551
Luke,Who do you think...,4,552
Luke,What is it?,4,553
Threepio,"I'm afraid I'm not quite sure, sir. He says ""I found her,"" and keepsrepeating, ""She's here.""",4,554
Luke,"Well, who... who has he found?",4,555
Threepio,Princess Leia.,4,556
Luke,The princess?  She's here?,4,557
Han,Princess?,4,558
Luke,Where... where is she?,4,559
Han,Princess?  What's going on?,4,560
Threepio,Level five. Detention block AA-twenty-three.  I'm afraid she's scheduled to be terminated.,4,561
Luke,"Oh, no!  We've got to do something.",4,562
Han,What are you talking about?,4,563
Luke,The droid belongs to her.  She's the one in the message.  We've got to help her.,4,564
Han,"Now, look, don't get any funny ideas.  The old man wants us to wait right here.",4,565
Luke,"But he didn't know she was here.  Look, will you just find a way back into the detention block?",4,566
Han,I'm not going anywhere.,4,567
Luke,"They're going to execute her.  Look, a few minutes ago you said you didn't want to just wait here to be captured.  Now all you want to do is stay. ",4,568
Han,Marching into the detention area is not what I had in mind.,4,569
Luke,But they're going to kill her!,4,570
Han,Better her than me...,4,571
Luke,She's rich.,4,572
Han,Rich?,4,573
Luke,"Yes.  Rich, powerful!  Listen, if you were to rescue her, the reward would be...",4,574
Han,What?,4,575
Luke,Well more wealth that you can imagine.,4,576
Han,"I don't know, I can imagine quite a bit!",4,577
Luke,You'll get it!,4,578
Han,I better!,4,579
Luke,You will...,4,580
Han,"All right, kid.  But you'd better be right about this!",4,581
Luke,All right.,4,582
Han,What's your plan?,4,583
Luke,"Uh... Threepio, hand me those binders there will you?",4,584
Luke,"Okay.  Now, I'm going to put these on you.",4,585
Luke,"Okay.  Han, you put these on.",4,586
Han,"Don't worry, Chewie.  I think I know what he has in mind.",4,587
Threepio,"Master Luke, sir!  Pardon me for asking... but, ah... what should Artoo and I do if we're discovered here?",4,588
Luke,Lock the door!,4,589
Han,And hope they don't have blasters.,4,590
Threepio,That isn't very reassuring.,4,591
Luke,I can't see a thing in this helmet.,4,592
Han,This is not going to work.,4,593
Luke,Why didn't you say so before?,4,594
Han,I did say so before!,4,595
Officer,Where are you taking this... thing?,4,596
Luke,Prisoner transfer from Block one-one-three-eight.,4,597
Officer,I wasn't notified.  I'll have to clear it.,4,598
Han,Look out!  He's loose!,4,599
Luke,He's going to pull us all apart.,4,600
Han,Go get him!,4,601
Han,We've got to find out which cell this princess of yours is in.  Here it is... cell twenty-one-eight-seven.  You go get her.  I'll hold them here.,4,602
Han,Everything is under control.  Situation normal.,4,603
Intercom Voice,What happened?,4,604
Han,"Uh... had a slight weapons malfunction.  But, uh, everything's perfectly all right now.  We're fine.  We're all fine here, now, thank you.  How are you?",4,605
Intercom Voice,We're sending a squad up.,4,606
Han,"Uh, uh, negative, negative.  We had a reactor leak here now.  Give us a few minutes to lock it down.  Large leak... very dangerous.",4,607
Intercom Voice,Who is this?  What's your operating number?,4,608
Han,Boring conversation anyway.Luke!  We're going to have company!,4,609
Leia,Aren't you a little short for a stormtrooper?,4,610
Luke,What?  Oh... the uniform.  I'm Luke Skywalker.  I'm here to rescue you. ,4,611
Leia,You're who?,4,612
Luke,I'm here to rescue you.  I've got your R2 unit.  I'm here with Ben Kenobi.,4,613
Leia,Ben Kenobi is here!  Where is he?,4,614
Luke,Come on!,4,615
Vader,He is here...,4,616
Tarkin,Obi-Wan Kenobi!  What makes you think so?,4,617
Vader,A tremor in the Force.  The last time I felt it was in the presence of my old master.,4,618
Tarkin,Surely he must be dead by now.,4,619
Vader,Don't underestimate the Force.,4,620
Tarkin,"The Jedi are extinct, their fire has gone out of the universe.  You, my friend, are all that's left of their religion.",4,621
Tarkin,Yes.,4,622
Intercom Voice,"Governor Tarkin, we have an emergency alert in detention block AA-twenty-three.",4,623
Tarkin,The princess!  Put all sections on alert!,4,624
Vader,Obi-Wan is here.  The Force is with him.,4,625
Tarkin,"If you're right, he must not be allowed to escape.",4,626
Vader,Escape may not his plan.  I must face him alone.,4,627
Han,Chewie!,4,628
Han,Get behind me!  Get behind me!,4,629
Han,Can't get out that way.,4,630
Leia,Looks like you managed to cut off our only escape route.,4,631
Han,"Maybe you'd like it back in your cell, Your Highness.",4,632
Luke,See-Threepio!  See-Threepio!,4,633
Threepio,Yes sir?,4,634
Luke,We've been cut off!  Are there any other ways out of the cell bay?...What was that?  I didn't copy!,4,635
Threepio,"I said, all systems have been alerted to your presence, sir.  The main entrance seems to be the only way out; all other information on your level is restricted.",4,636
Trooper Voice,Open up in there!,4,637
Threepio,"Oh, no!",4,638
Luke,There isn't any other way out.,4,639
Han,I can't hold them off forever!  Now what?,4,640
Leia,"This is some rescue.  When you came in here, didn't you have a plan for getting out?",4,641
Han,"He's the brains, sweetheart.",4,642
Luke,"Well, I didn't...",4,643
Han,What the hell are you doing?,4,644
Leia,"Somebody has to save our skins.  Into the garbage chute, wise guy.",4,645
Han,Get in there you big furry oaf!  I don't care what you smell!  Get in there and don't worry about it.,4,646
Han,Wonderful girl!  Either I'm going to kill her or I'm beginning to like her.  Get in there!,4,647
Han,Oh!  The garbage chute was a really wonderful idea.  What an incredible smell you've discovered!  Let's get out of here!  Get away from there...,4,648
Luke,No!  wait!,4,649
Luke,Will you forget it?  I already tried it.  It's magnetically sealed!,4,650
Leia,Put that thing away!  You're going to get us all killed.,4,651
Han,"Absolutely, Your Worship.  Look, I had everything under control until you led us down here.  You know, it's not going to take them long to figure out what happened to us.",4,652
Leia,It could be worse...,4,653
Han,It's worse.,4,654
Luke,There's something alive in here!,4,655
Han,That's your imagination.,4,656
Luke,Something just moves past my leg!  Look!  Did you see that?,4,657
Han,What?,4,658
Luke,Help!,4,659
Han,Luke!  Luke!  Luke!,4,660
Leia,Luke!,4,661
Leia,"Luke, Luke, grab a hold of this.",4,662
Luke,"Blast it, will you!  My gun's jammed.",4,663
Han,Where?,4,664
Luke,Anywhere!  Oh!!,4,665
Han,Luke!  Luke!,4,666
Leia,Grab him!,4,667
Leia,What happened?,4,668
Luke,"I don't know, it just let go of me and disappeared...",4,669
Han,I've got a very bad feeling about this.,4,670
Luke,The walls are moving!,4,671
Leia,Don't just stand there.  Try and brace it with something.,4,672
Luke,Wait a minute!,4,673
Luke,Threepio!  Come in Threepio!  Threepio!  Where could he be?,4,674
First Trooper,Take over!See to him!  Look there!,4,675
Threepio,"They're madmen!  They're heading for the prison level.  If you hurry, you might catch them.",4,676
First Officer,Follow me!  You stand guard.,4,677
Threepio,Come on!,4,678
Threepio,"Oh!  All this excitement has overrun the circuits of my counterpart here.  If you don't mind, I'd like to take him down to maintenance.",4,679
Trooper,All right.,4,680
Luke,"Threepio!  Come in, Threepio!  Threepio!",4,681
Han,Get to the top!,4,682
Leia,I can't ,4,683
Luke,"Where could he be?  Threepio!  Threepio, will you come in?",4,684
Threepio,They aren't here!  Something must have happened to them.  See if they've been captured.,4,685
Threepio,Hurry!,4,686
Han,One thing's for sure.  We're all going to be a lot thinner!Get on top of it!,4,687
Leia,I'm trying!,4,688
Threepio,"Thank goodness, they haven't found them!  Where could they be?",4,689
Threepio,"Use the comlink?  Oh, my!  I forgot I turned it off!",4,690
Threepio,"Are you there, sir?",4,691
Luke,Threepio!,4,692
Threepio,We've had some problems...,4,693
Luke,"Shut down all the garbage mashers on the detention level, will you?  Do you copy?",4,694
Luke,Shut down all the garbage mashers on the detention level.,4,695
Luke,Shut down all the garbage mashers on the detention level.,4,696
Threepio,No.  Shut them all down!  Hurry!,4,697
Threepio,"Listen to them!  They're dying, Artoo!  Curse my metal body!  I wasn't fast enough.  It's all my fault!  My poor master!",4,698
Luke,"Threepio, we're all right!",4,699
Luke,We're all right.  You did great.,4,700
Luke,"Hey... hey, open the pressure maintenance hatch on unit number... where are we?",4,701
Han,Three-two-six-eight-two-seven.,4,702
Han,"If we can just avoid any more female advice, we ought to be able to get out of here.",4,703
Luke,"Well, let's get moving!",4,704
Han,Where are you going?,4,705
Leia,"No, wait.  They'll hear!",4,706
Han,"Come here, you big coward!",4,707
Han,Chewie!  Come here!,4,708
Leia,"Listen. I don't know who you are, or where you came from, but from now on, you do as I tell you.  Okay?",4,709
Han,"Look, Your Worshipfulness, let's get one thing straight!  I takeorders from one person!  Me!",4,710
Leia,It's a wonder you're still alive.Will somebody get this big walking carpet out of my way?,4,711
Han,No reward is worth this.,4,712
Officer,Secure this area until the alert is canceled.,4,713
First Trooper,Give me regular reports.,4,714
First Trooper,Do you know what's going on?,4,715
Second Trooper,Maybe it's another drill.,4,716
Second Trooper,What was that?,4,717
First Trooper,"Oh, it's nothing.  Don't worry about it.",4,718
Han,There she is.,4,719
Luke,"See-Threepio, do you copy?",4,720
Threepio,"For the moment.  Uh, we're in the main hangar across from the ship.",4,721
Luke,We're right above you.  Stand by.,4,722
Leia,You came in that thing?  You're braver that I thought.,4,723
Han,Nice!  Come on!,4,724
First Trooper,It's them!  Blast them!,4,725
Han,Get back to the ship!,4,726
Luke,Where are you going?  Come back!,4,727
Leia,He certainly has courage.,4,728
Luke,What good will it do us if he gets himself killed?  Come on!,4,729
Luke,I think we took a wrong turn.,4,730
Leia,There's no lock!,4,731
Luke,That oughta hold it for a while.,4,732
Leia,"Quick, we've got to get across.  Find the control that extends the bridge.",4,733
Luke,"Oh, I think I just blasted it.",4,734
Leia,They're coming through!,4,735
Luke,"Here, hold this.",4,736
Leia,Here they come!,4,737
Leia,For luck!,4,738
Threepio,Where could they be?,4,739
Trooper,Close the blast doors!,4,740
Trooper,Open the blast doors!  Open the blast doors!,4,741
Vader,"I've been waiting for you, Obi-Wan.  We meet again, at last.  The circle is now complete.",4,742
Vader,"When I left you, I was but the learner; now I am the master.",4,743
Ben,"Only a master of evil, Darth.",4,744
Vader,"Your powers are weak, old man.",4,745
Ben,"You can't win, Darth.  If you strike me down, I shall become more powerful than you can possibly imagine.",4,746
Han,Didn't we just leave this party?,4,747
Han,What kept you?,4,748
Leia,We ran into some old friends.,4,749
Luke,Is the ship all right?,4,750
Han,"Seems okay, if we can get to it.Just hope the old man got the tractor beam out of commission.",4,751
Luke,Look!,4,752
Threepio,"Come on, Artoo, we're going!",4,753
Han,Now's our chance!  Go!,4,754
Luke,No!,4,755
Han,Come on!,4,756
Leia,"Come on!  Luke, its too late!",4,757
Han,Blast the door!  Kid!,4,758
Ben,"Run, Luke!  Run!",4,759
Han,"I hope the old man got that tractor beam out if commission, or this is going to be a real short trip.  Okay, hit it!",4,760
Han,We're coming up on the sentry ships.  Hold 'em off!  Angle the deflector shields while I charge up the main guns!,4,761
Luke,I can't believe he's gone.,4,762
Leia,There wasn't anything you could have done.,4,763
Han,"Come on, buddy, we're not out of this yet!",4,764
Han,"You in, kid?  Okay, stay sharp!",4,765
Leia,Here they come!,4,766
Luke,They're coming in too fast!,4,767
Threepio,Oooh!,4,768
Leia,We've lost lateral controls.,4,769
Han,"Don't worry, she'll hold together.",4,770
Han,"You hear me, baby?  Hold together!",4,771
Luke,Got him!  I got him!,4,772
Han,Great kid!  Don't get cocky.,4,773
Leia,There are still two more of them out there!,4,774
Luke,That's it!  We did it!,4,775
Leia,We did it!,4,776
Threepio,Help!  I think I'm melting!This is all your fault.,4,777
Tarkin,Are they away?,4,778
Vader,They have just made the jump into hyperspace.,4,779
Tarkin,"You're sure the homing beacon is secure aboard their ship?  I'm taking an awful risk, Vader.  This had better work.",4,780
Han,"Not a bad bit of rescuing, huh?  You know, sometimes I even amaze myself.",4,781
Leia,"That doesn't sound too hard.  Besides, they let us go.  It's the only explanation for the ease of our escape.",4,782
Han,Easy... you call that easy?,4,783
Leia,Their tracking us!,4,784
Han,"Not this ship, sister.",4,785
Leia,At least the information in Artoo is still intact.,4,786
Han,What's so important?  What's he carrying?,4,787
Leia,"The technical readouts of that battle station.  I only hope that when the data is analyzed, a weakness can be found.  It's not over yet!",4,788
Han,"It is for me, sister!  Look, I ain't in this for your revolution, and I'm not in it for you, Princess.  I expect to be well paid.  I'm in it for the money!",4,789
Leia,"You needn't worry about your reward.  If money is all that you love, then that's what you'll receive!",4,790
Leia,Your friend is quite a mercenary.  I wonder if he really cares about anything... or anyone.,4,791
Luke,I care!,4,792
Luke,"So... what do you think of her, Han?",4,793
Han,"I'm trying not to, kid!",4,794
Luke,Good...,4,795
Han,"Still, she's got a lot of spirit.  I don't know, what do you think?  Do you think a princess and a guy like me...",4,796
Luke,No!,4,797
Willard,You're safe!  We had feared the worst.,4,798
Willard,"When we heard about Alderaan, we were afraid that you were... lost along with your father.",4,799
Leia,"We don't have time for our sorrows, commander.  The battle station has surely tracked us here.It's the only explanation for the ease of our escape.  You must use the information in this R2 unit to plan the attack.  It is our only hope.",4,800
Tarkin,Yes.,4,801
Death Star Intercom Voice,We are approaching the planet Yavin.  The Rebel base is on a moon on the far side.  We are preparing to orbit the planet.,4,802
Dodonna,The battle station is heavily shielded and carries a firepower greater than half the star fleet.Its defenses are designed around a direct large-scale assault.  A small one-man fighter should be able to penetrate the outer defense.,4,803
Gold Leader,"Pardon me for asking, sir, but what good are snub fighters going to be against that?",4,804
Dodonna,"Well, the Empire doesn't consider a small one-man fighter to be any threat, or they'd have a tighter defense.  An analysis of the plans provided by Princess Leia has demonstrated a weakness in the battle station.",4,805
Dodonna,"The approach will not be easy.  You are required to maneuver straight down this trench and skim the surface to this point.  The target area is only two meters wide.  It's a small thermal exhaust port, right below the main port.  The shaft leads directly to the reactor system.  A precise hit will start a chain reaction which should destroy the station.",4,806
Dodonna,"Only a precise hit will set up a chain reaction.  The shaft is ray-shielded, so you'll have to use proton torpedoes.",4,807
Wedge,"That's impossible, even for a computer.",4,808
Luke,It's not impossible.  I used to bullseye womp rats in my T-sixteen back home.  They're not much bigger than two meters.,4,809
Dodonna,Man your ships!  And may the Force be with you!,4,810
Death Star Intercom Voice,Orbiting the planet at maximum velocity.  The moon with the Rebel base will be in range in thirty minutes.,4,811
Vader,This will be a day long remembered.  It has seen the end of Kenobi and it will soon see the end of the Rebellion.,4,812
Man,"All flight troops, man your stations.  All flight troops, man your stations.",4,813
Luke,So... you got your reward and you're just leaving then?,4,814
Han,"That's right, yeah!  I got some old debts I've got to pay off with this stuff.  Even if I didn't, you don't think I'd be fool enough to stick around here, do you?  Why don't you come with us?  You're pretty good in a fight.  I could use you.",4,815
Luke,"Come on!  Why don't you take a look around?  You know what's about to happen, what they're up against.  They could use a good pilot like you.  You're turning your back on them.",4,816
Han,"What good's a reward if you ain't around to use it?  Besides, attacking that battle station ain'tmy idea of courage.  It's more like suicide.",4,817
Luke,"All right.  Well, take care of yourself, Han... guess that's what you're best at, isn't it?",4,818
Han,"Hey, Luke... may the Force be with you!",4,819
Han,What're you lookin' at?  I know what I'm doing.,4,820
Leia,What's wrong?,4,821
Luke,"Oh, it's Han!  I don't know, I really thought he'd change his mind. ",4,822
Leia,He's got to follow his own path.  No one can choose it for him.,4,823
Luke,I only wish Ben were here.,4,824
Biggs,Luke!  I don't believe it!  How'd you get here... are you going out with us?!,4,825
Luke,"Biggs!  Of course, I'll be up there with you!  Listen, have I got some stories to tell...",4,826
Red Leader,Are you... Luke Skywalker?  Have you been checked out on the Incom T-sixty-five?,4,827
Biggs,"Sir, Luke is the best bushpilot in the outer rim territories.",4,828
Red Leader,"I met your father once when I was just a boy.  He was a great pilot.  You'll do all right.  If you've got half of your father's skill, you'll do better than all right.",4,829
Luke,"Thank you, sir.  I'll try.",4,830
Biggs,"I've got to get aboard.  Listen, you'll tell me your stories when we come back.  All right?",4,831
Luke,"I told you I'd make it someday, Biggs.",4,832
Biggs,"You did, all right.  It's going to be like old times Luke. We're a couple of shooting stars that'll never be stopped!",4,833
Chief,This R2 unit of your seems a bit beat up.  Do you want a new one?,4,834
Luke,"Not on your life!  That little droid and I have been through a lot together.You okay, Artoo?",4,835
Chief,"Okay, easy she goes!",4,836
Threepio,"Hang on tight, Artoo, you've got to come back.",4,837
Threepio,"You wouldn't want my life to get boring, would you?",4,838
Ben,"Luke, the Force will be with you.",4,839

Biggs,Are you all right?,4,866
Luke,"I got a little cooked, but I'm okay.",4,867
Astro-Officer,"We count thirty Rebel ships, Lord Vader.  But they're so small they're evading our turbo-lasers!",4,868
Vader,We'll have to destroy them ship to ship.  Get the crews to their fighters.,4,869
Red Leader,"Luke, let me know when you're going in.",4,870
Luke,I'm on my way in now...,4,871
Red Leader,Watch yourself!  There's a lot of fire coming from the right side of that deflection tower.,4,872
Luke,I'm on it.,4,873
Control Officer,"Squad leaders, we've picked up a new group of signals.  Enemy fighters coming your way.",4,874
Luke,My scope's negative.  I don't see anything.,4,875
Red Leader,"Keep up your visual scanning.  With all this jamming, they'll be on top of you before your scope can pick them up.",4,876
Red Leader,Biggs!  You've picked one up... watch it!,4,877
Biggs,I can't see it!  Where is he?!,4,878
Biggs,"He's on me tight, I can't shake him... I can't shake him.",4,879
Luke,"Hang on, Biggs, I'm coming in.",4,880
Luke,Got him!,4,881

Red Ten,I can't hold them!,4,947
Red Leader,It's away!,4,948
Red Nine,It's a hit!,4,949
Red Leader,Negative.,4,950
Red Leader,"Negative!  It didn't go in, it just impacted on the surface.",4,951
Luke,"Red Leader, we're right above you.  Turn to point...",4,952
Luke,... oh-five; we'll cover for you.,4,953
Red Leader,Stay there...,4,954
Red Leader,... I just lost my starboard engine.,4,955
Red Leader,Get set up for your attack run.,4,956
Death Star Intercom Voice,"Rebel base, one minute and closing.",4,957
Luke,"Biggs, Wedge, let's close it up.  We're going in.  We're going in full throttle.",4,958
Wedge,"Right with you, boss.",4,959
Biggs,"Luke, at that speed will you be able to pull out in time?",4,960
Luke,It'll be just like Beggar's Canyon back home.,4,961
Biggs,We'll stay back far enough to cover you.,4,962
Wedge,"My scope shows the tower, but I can't see the exhaust port!  Are you sure the computer can hit it?",4,963
Luke,Watch yourself!  Increase speed full throttle!,4,964
Wedge,What about that tower?,4,965
Luke,You worry about those fighters!  I'll worry about the tower!,4,966
Luke,"Artoo... that, that stabilizer's broken loose again!  See if you can't lock it down!",4,967
Wedge,I'm hit!  I can't stay with you.,4,968
Luke,"Get clear, Wedge.",4,969
Luke,You can't do any more good back there!,4,970
Wedge,Sorry!,4,971
Vader,Let him go!  Stay on the leader!,4,972

Luke,"Artoo, try and increase the power!",4,974
Biggs,"Hurry up, Luke!",4,975
Biggs,Wait!,4,976
Death Star Intercom Voice,"Rebel base, thirty seconds and closing.",4,977
Vader,I'm on the leader.,4,978
Threepio,"Hang on, Artoo!",4,979
Ben,"Use the Force, Luke.",4,980
Ben,"Let go, Luke.",4,981
Vader,The Force is strong with this one!,4,982
Ben,"Luke, trust me.",4,983
Base Voice,"His computer's off.  Luke, you switched off your targeting computer.  What's wrong?",4,984
Luke,Nothing.  I'm all right.,4,985
Luke,I've lost Artoo!,4,986

Leia,Luke!  Luke!  Luke!,4,1001
Han,Hey!  Hey!,4,1002
Luke,I knew you'd come back!  I just knew it!,4,1003
Han,"Well, I wasn't gonna let you get all the credit and take all the reward.",4,1004
Leia,"Hey, I knew there was more to you than money.",4,1005
Luke,"Oh, no!",4,1006
Threepio,"Oh, my!  Artoo!  Can you hear me?  Say something!You can repair him, can't you?",4,1007
Technician,We'll get to work on him right away.,4,1008
Threepio,"You must repair him!  Sir, if any of my circuits or gears will help, I'll gladly donate them.",4,1009
Luke,He'll be all right.,4,1010
Luke,"Echo Three to Echo Seven. Han, old buddy, do you  read me?",5,1
Han,"Loud and clear, kid. What's up?",5,2
Luke,"Well, I finished my circle. I don't pick up any  life readings.",5,3
Han,There isn't enough life on this ice cube to fill a  space cruiser. The sensors are placed. I'm going back.,5,4
Luke,Right. I'll see you shortly. There's a meteorite  that hit the ground near here. I want to check it out. It won't take long.,5,5
Luke,"Hey, steady girl. What's the matter? You smell something?",5,6
Luke,Aaargh!,5,7
Han,Chewie!,5,8
Han,"All right, don't lose your temper. I'll come right back and give  you a hand.",5,9
Rieekan,Solo?,5,10
Han,"No sign of life out there, General. The sensors are in place.  You'll know if anything comes around.",5,11
Rieekan,Commander Skywalker reported in yet?,5,12
Han,No. He's checking out a meteorite that hit near him.,5,13
Rieekan,"With all the meteor activity in this  system, it's going to be difficult to spot approaching ships.",5,14
Han,"General, I've got to leave. I can't stay anymore.",5,15
Rieekan,I'm sorry to hear that.,5,16
Han,"Well, there's a price on my head. If I don't pay off Jabba the  Hut, I'm a dead man.",5,17
Rieekan,"A death mark's not an easy thing to live with. You're a good  fighter, Solo. I hate to lose you.",5,18
Han,"Thank you, General.",5,19
Han,"Well, Your Highness, I guess this is it.",5,20
Leia,That's right.,5,21
Han,"Well, don't get all mushy on me. So long, Princess.",5,22
Leia,Han!,5,23
Han,"Yes, Your Highnessness?",5,24
Leia,I thought you decided to stay.,5,25
Han,"Well, the bounty hunter we ran into on Ord Mantell changed my  mind.",5,26
Leia,"Han, we need you!",5,27
Han,We?,5,28
Leia,Yes.,5,29
Han,"Oh, what about you need?",5,30
Leia,I need? I don't know what you're talking about.,5,31
Han,You probably don't.,5,32
Leia,And what precisely am I supposed to know?,5,33
Han,Come on! You want me to stay because of the way you feel about  me.,5,34
Leia,Yes. You're a great help to us. You're a natural leader...,5,35
Han,No! That's not it. Come on. Aahhh -- uh huh! Come on.,5,36
Leia,You're imagining things.,5,37
Han,Am I? Then why are you following me? Afraid I was going to leave  without giving you a goodbye kiss?,5,38
Leia,I'd just as soon kiss a Wookiee.,5,39
Han,I can arrange that. You could use a good kiss!,5,40
Threepio,Don't try to blame me. I didn't ask you to turn on the  thermal heater. I merely commented that it was freezing in the princess's chamber. But it's supposed to be freezing. How are we going to dry out all her clothes? I really don't know.,5,41
Threepio,"Oh, switch off.",5,42
Han,Why do you take this apart now? I'm trying to get us  out of here and you pull both of these.,5,43
Threepio,"Excuse me, sir.",5,44
Han,Put them back together right now.,5,45
Threepio,"Might I have a word with you, please?",5,46
Han,What do you want?,5,47
Threepio,"Well, it's Princess Leia, sir. She's been trying to get you  on the communicator.",5,48
Han,I turned it off. I don't want to talk to her.,5,49
Threepio,"Oh. Well, Princess Leia is wondering about Master Luke. He  hasn't come back yet. She doesn't know where he is.",5,50
Han,I don't know where he is.,5,51
Threepio,Nobody knows where he is.,5,52
Han,"What do you mean, ""nobody knows""?",5,53
Threepio,"Well, uh, you see...",5,54
Han,Deck Officer. Deck Officer!,5,55
Threepio,"Excuse me, sir. Might I inqu-...",5,56
Deck Officer,"Yes, sir?",5,57
Han,Do you know where Commander Skywalker is?,5,58
Deck Officer,I haven't seen him. It's possible he came in through the  south entrance.,5,59
Han,It's possible? Why don't you go find out? It's getting dark out  there.,5,60
Deck Officer,"Yes, sir.",5,61
Threepio,"Excuse me, sir. Might I inquire what's going on?",5,62
Han,Why not?,5,63
Threepio,"Impossible man. Come along, Artoo, lets find Princess Leia.  Between ourselves, I think Master Luke is in considerable danger.",5,64
Deck Officer,"Sir, Commander Skywalker hasn't come in through the  south entrance. He might have forgotten to check in.",5,65
Han,Not likely. Are the speeders ready?,5,66
Deck Officer,Not yet. We're having some trouble adapting them to the  cold.,5,67
Han,Then we'll have to go out on Tauntauns.,5,68
Deck Officer,"Sir, the temperature's dropping too rapidly.",5,69
Han,That's right. And my friends out in it.,5,70
Assistant Officer,I'll cover sector twelve. Have com-control set  screen alpha.,5,71
Deck Officer,Your Tauntaun'll freeze before you reach the first  marker.,5,72
Han,Then I'll see you in hell!,5,73
Threepio,"You must come along now, Artoo. There's really nothing more  we can do. And my joints are freezing up.",5,74
Threepio,"Don't say thing like that! Of course we'll see Master Luke  again. He'll be quite all right, you'll see.  Stupid little short-circuit. He'll be quite all right.",5,75
Lieutenant,"Sir, all the patrols are in. There's still no contact from  Skywalker or Solo.",5,76
Threepio,"Mistress Leia, Artoo says he's been quite unable to pick up  any signals, although he does admit that his own range is far too weak to abandon all hope.",5,77
Derlin,"Your Highness, there's nothing more we can do tonight. The  shield doors must be closed.",5,78
Derlin,Close the doors.,5,79
Lieutenant,"Yes, sir.",5,80
Threepio,Artoo says the chances of survival are seven hundred  seventy-five...to one.,5,81
Threepio,"Actually, Artoo has been known to make mistakes...from time  to time. Oh, dear, oh, dear. Don't worry about Master Luke. I'm sure he'll be all right. He's quite clever, you know...for a human being.",5,82
Ben,Luke...Luke.,5,83
Luke,Ben?,5,84
Ben,You will go to the Dagobah system.,5,85
Luke,Dagobah system?,5,86
Ben,"There you will learn from Yoda, the Jedi Master who instructed  me.",5,87
Luke,Ben...Ben.,5,88
Han,"Luke! Luke! Don't do this, Luke. Come on, give me a sign here.",5,89
Han,Not much time.,5,90
Luke,Ben...Ben...,5,91
Han,"Hang on, kid.",5,92
Luke,Dagobah system...,5,93
Han,Whew...,5,94
Luke,Dagobah...,5,95
Han,"This may smell bad, kid...",5,96
Luke,Yoda...,5,97
Han,...but it will keep you warm...til I get the shelter built.   Ooh...I thought they smelled bad on the outside!,5,98
Zev,"Echo Base...I've got something! Not much, but  it could be a life form.",5,99
Zev,"This is Rouge Two. this is Rouge Two. Captain  Solo, so you copy? Commander Skywalker, do you copy? This is Rouge Two.",5,100
Han,Good morning. Nice of you guys to  drop by.,5,101
Zev,"Echo Base...this is Rouge Two. I found  them. Repeat, I found them.",5,102
Threepio,"Master Luke, sir, it's good to see you fully functional  again.",5,103
Threepio,"Artoo expresses his relief, also.",5,104
Han,"How are you feeling, kid? You don't look so bad to me. In fact,  you look strong enough to pull the ears off a Gundark.",5,105
Luke,Thanks to you.,5,106
Han,"That's two you owe me, junior.",5,107
Han,"Well your Worship, looks like you managed to keep me around for a  little while longer.",5,108
Leia,I had nothing to do with it. General Rieekan thinks  it's dangerous for any ships to leave the system until we've activated the energy shield.,5,109
Han,That's a good story. I think you just can't bear to let a  gorgeous guy like me out of your sight.,5,110
Leia,"I don't know where you get you delusions, laser brain.",5,111
Han,"Laugh it up, fuzz ball. But you didn't see us alone in the south  passage.",5,112
Han,She expressed her true feelings for me.,5,113
Leia,"My...! Why, you stuck up,...half-witted,...scruffy-looking...  nerf-herder!",5,114
Han,"Who's scruffy-looking?  I must have hit her pretty close  to the mark to get her all riled up like that, huh, kid?",5,115
Leia,"Why, I guess you don't know everything about women yet?",5,116
Announcer,"Headquarters personnel, report to command  center.",5,117
Han,Take it easy.,5,118
Threepio,"Excuse us, please.",5,119
Rieekan,Princess...we have a visitor.,5,120
Rieekan,"We've picked up something outside the base in zone twelve,  moving east.",5,121
Senior Controller,It's metal.,5,122
Leia,Then it couldn't be one of those creatures that attacked Luke.,5,123
Han,"It could be a speeder, one of ours.",5,124
Senior Controller,No. Wait -- there's something very weak coming  through.,5,125
Threepio,"Sir, I am fluent in six million forms of communication. This  signal is not used by the Alliance. It could be an Imperial code.",5,126
Han,"It isn't friendly, whatever it is. Come on, Chewie, let's check  it out.",5,127
Rieekan,Send Rouges Ten and Eleven to station three-eight.,5,128
Han,Afraid there's not much left.,5,129
Leia,What was it?,5,130
Han,Droid of some kind. I didn't hit it that hard. It  must have had a self-destruct.,5,131
Leia,An Imperial probe droid.,5,132
Han,It's a good bet the Empire knows we're here.,5,133
Rieekan,We'd better start the evacuation.,5,134
Piett,Admiral.,5,135
Ozzel,"Yes, Captain",5,136
Piett,"I think we've got something, sir. The report is only a fragment  had.",5,137
Ozzel,"We have thousands of probe droids searching the  galaxy. I want proof, not leads!",5,138
Piett,The visuals indicate life readings.,5,139
Ozzel,It could mean anything. If we followed every lead...,5,140
Piett,"But, sir, the Hoth system is supposed to be devoid of human  forms.",5,141
Vader,You found something?,5,142
Piett,"Yes, my lord.",5,143
Vader,That's it. The  Rebels are there.,5,144
Ozzel,"My lord, there are so many uncharted settlements. It could be  smugglers, it could be...",5,145
Vader,"That is the system. And I'm sure Skywalker is with them. Set  your course for the Hoth system. General Veers, prepare you men.",5,146
Rebel Captain,"Groups seven and ten will stay behind to fly the  speeders. As soon as each transport is loaded, evacuation control will give clearance for immediate launch.",5,147
Rebel Fighter,"Right, sir.",5,148
Han,"Okay, that's it. Try it...Off! Turn it  off! Turn it off! Off!",5,149
Medical Droid,"Sir, it will take quite awhile to evacuate the T-forty-  sevens.",5,150
Luke,"Well, forget the heavy equipment. There's plenty of time to get  the smaller modules on the transports.",5,151
Medical Droid,"Take care, sir.",5,152
Luke,Thanks.,5,153
Luke,"Chewie, take care of yourself, okay?",5,154
Han,"Hi, kid.  There's got to be a reason for it. Check it  at the other end. Wait a second.  You all right?",5,155
Luke,Yeah.,5,156
Han,Be careful.,5,157
Luke,"You, too.",5,158
Controller,"General, there's a fleet of Star Destroyers coming out of  hyperspace in sector four.",5,159
Rieekan,Reroute all power to the energy shield. We've got to hold  them till all transports are away. Prepare for ground assault.,5,160
Vader,"What is it, General?",5,161
Veers,"My lord, the fleet has moves out of light-speed. Com-Scan has  detected an energy field protecting an area around the sixth planet of the Hoth system. The field is strong enough to deflect any bombardment.",5,162
Vader,The Rebels are alerted to our presence. Admiral Ozzel  came out of light-speed too close to the system.,5,163
Veers,He felt surprise was wiser...,5,164
Vader,"He is as clumsy as he is stupid. General, prepare your troops  for a surface attack.",5,165
Veers,"Yes, my lord.",5,166
Ozzel,"Lord Vader, the fleet has moved out of light-speed, and we're  preparing to...Aaagh!",5,167
Vader,"You have failed me for the last time, Admiral. Captain Piett.",5,168
Piett,"Yes, my lord.",5,169
Vader,"Make ready to land out troops beyond the energy shield and  deploy the fleet so that nothing gets off that system. You are in command now, Admiral Piett.",5,170
Piett,"Thank you, Lord Vader.",5,171
Leia,"All troop carriers will assemble at the north entrance. The  heavy transport ships will leave as soon as they're loaded. Only two fighter escorts per ship. The energy shield can only be opened for a short time, so you'll have to stay very close to your transports.",5,172
Hobbie,Two fighters against a Star Destroyer?,5,173
Leia,"The ion cannon will fire several shots to make sure that any  enemy ships will be out of your flight path. When you've gotten past the energy shield, proceed directly to the rendezvous point. Understood?",5,174
Pilots,Right. Okay.,5,175
Leia,Good luck.,5,176
Derlin,Okay. Everyone to your stations. Let's go!,5,177
Rieekan,Their primary target will be the power generators. Prepare to  open the shield.,5,178
Controller,"Sir, Rebel ships are coming into our sector.",5,179
Captain,Good. Our first catch of the day.,5,180
Woman Controller,"Stand by, ion control....Fire!",5,181
Announcer,The first transport is away.,5,182
Dack,"Feeling all right, sir?",5,183
Luke,"Just like new, Dack. How about you?",5,184
Dack,Right now I feel I could take on the whole Empire myself.,5,185
Luke,I know what you mean.,5,186
Trench Officer,Echo Station Three-T-Eight.,5,187
Trench Officer,We have spotted Imperial walkers!,5,188
Controller,Imperial walkers on the north ridge.,5,189
Luke,Echo station Five-Seven. We're on our way.,5,190
Luke,"All right, boys, keep tight now.",5,191
Dack,"Luke, I have no approach vector. I'm not set.",5,192
Luke,"Steady, Dack. Attack pattern delta. Go now!",5,193
Luke,"All right, I'm coming in.",5,194
Luke,"Hobbie, you still with me?",5,195
Luke,That armor's too strong for blasters.,5,196
Luke,"Rouge Group, use your harpoons and tow cables. Go  for the legs. It might be our only chance of stopping them.  All right, stand by, Dack.",5,197
Dack,"Luke, we've got a malfunction in fire control. I'll have to cut  in the auxiliary.",5,198
Luke,"Just hang on. Hang on, Dack. Get ready to fire that tow cable.",5,199
Luke,Dack? Dack!,5,200
Veers,"Yes, Lord Vader. I've reached the main power generator. The  shield will be down in moments. You may start your landing.",5,201
Luke,Rouge Three.,5,202
Wedge,"Copy, Rouge Leader",5,203
Luke,"Wedge, I've lost my gunner. You'll have to make  this shot. I'll cover for you. Set your harpoon. Follow me on the next pass.",5,204
Wedge,"Coming around, Rouge Leader.",5,205
Luke,"Steady, Rouge Two",5,206
Wedge,Activate harpoon.,5,207
Wedge,"Good shot, Janson.",5,208
Wedge,One more pass.,5,209
Janson,Coming around. Once more.,5,210
Janson,One more.,5,211
Janson,Cable out! Let her go!,5,212
Wedge,Detach cable.,5,213
Janson,Cable detached.,5,214
Trench Officer,Come on!,5,215
Wedge,Whooha!! That got him!,5,216
Luke,"I see it, Wedge. Good work.",5,217
Rieekan,I don't think we can protect two transports at a time.,5,218
Leia,"It's risky, but we can't hold out much longer. We have no  choice.",5,219
Rieekan,Launch patrols.,5,220
Leia,Evacuate remaining ground staff.,5,221
Han,"No, no! No! This one goes there, that one goes there. right?",5,222
Threepio,"Artoo, you take good care of Master Luke now, understand?  And...do take care of yourself. Oh, dear, oh, dear.",5,223
Veers,All troops will debark for ground assault. Prepare to target  the main generator.,5,224
Luke,"Rouge Two, are you all right?",5,225
Zev,"Yeah. I'm with you, Rouge Leader.",5,226
Luke,We'll set harpoon. I'll cover for you.,5,227
Zev,Coming around.,5,228
Luke,"Watch that cross fire, boys.",5,229
Zev,Set for position three.  Steady.,5,230
Luke,Stay tight and low.,5,231
Luke,"Hobbie, I've been hit!",5,232
Han,You all right?,5,233
Leia,Why are you still here?,5,234
Han,I heard the command center had been hit.,5,235
Leia,You got your clearance to leave.,5,236
Han,Don't worry. I'll leave. First I'm going to get you to your ship.,5,237
Threepio,"Your Highness, we must take this last transport. It's our  only hope.",5,238
Leia,Send all troops in sector twelve to the south  slope to protect the fighters.,5,239
Announcer,Imperial troops have entered the base.,5,240
Han,Come on...that's it.,5,241
Leia,Give the evacuation code signal. And get to  your transports!,5,242
Head Controller,K-one-zero...all troops disengage.,5,243
Threepio,Oh! Wait for me!,5,244
Officer,Begin retreat!,5,245
Second Officer,Fall back!,5,246
Veers,Distance to power generators?,5,247
Pilot,"One-seven, decimal two-eight.",5,248
Veers,Target. Maximum fire power.,5,249
Han,"Transport, this is Solo. Better take off -- I  can't get to you. I'll get the princess out on the Falcon.",5,250
Threepio,But...but...but...where are you going? Uh...come back!!,5,251
Threepio,Wait! Wait for me! Wait! Stop!,5,252
Threepio,How typical.,5,253
Han,Come on.,5,254
Han,"Hurry up, goldenrod, or you're going to be a permanent resident!",5,255
Threepio,Wait! Wait!,5,256
Han,How's this?,5,257
Leia,Would it helped if I got out and pushed?,5,258
Han,It might.,5,259
Threepio,"Captain Solo, Captain Solo...sir, might I suggest that  you...",5,260
Threepio,It can wait.,5,261
Leia,The bucket of bolts is never going to get us past that blockade.,5,262
Han,"This baby's got a few surprises left in her, sweetheart.",5,263
Han,Come on! Come on! Switch over. Let's hope we don't have a  burnout.,5,264
Han,See?,5,265
Leia,"Someday you're going to be wrong, and I hope I'm there to see it.",5,266
Han,Punch it!,5,267
Luke,Artoo! Get her ready for takeoff.,5,268
Wedge,"Good luck, Luke. See you at the rendezvous.",5,269
Luke,"Don't worry, Artoo. We're going, we're going.",5,270
Luke,"There's nothing wrong, Artoo. I'm just setting a  new course.",5,271
Luke,We're not going to regroup with the others.,5,272
Luke,We're going to the Dagobah system.,5,273
Luke,"Yes, Artoo?",5,274
Luke,That's all right. I'd like to keep it  on manual control for a while.,5,275
Han,I saw them! I saw them!,5,276
Leia,Saw what?,5,277
Han,"Star Destroyers, two of them, coming right at us.",5,278
Threepio,"Sir, sir! Might I suggest...",5,279
Han,Shut him up or shut him down!  Check the  deflector shield!,5,280
Han,"Oh, great. Well, we can still outmaneuver them.",5,281
Imperial Officer,Take evasive action!,5,282
Han,Prepare to make the jump to light-speed.,5,283
Threepio,"But, sir!",5,284
Leia,They're getting closer!,5,285
Han,Oh yeah? Watch this.,5,286
Leia,Watch what?,5,287
Han,I think we're in trouble.,5,288
Threepio,"If I may say so, sir, I noticed earlier the hyperdrive  motivator has been damaged. It's impossible to go to light-speed!",5,289
Han,We're in trouble!,5,290
Han,Horizontal boosters...!,5,291
Han,Alluvial dampers...! Well that's not it.,5,292
Han,Bring me the hydrospanners!,5,293
Han,I don't know how we're going to get out of this one.,5,294
Han,Oww! Chewie!,5,295
Han,That was no laser blast! Something hit us.,5,296
Leia,"Han, get up here!",5,297
Han,"Come on, Chewie!",5,298
Leia,Asteroids!,5,299
Han,"Oh, no! Chewie, set two-seven-one.",5,300
Leia,What are you doing? You're not actually going into an asteroid  field?,5,301
Han,"They'd be crazy to follow us, wouldn't they?",5,302
Leia,You don't have to do this to impress me.,5,303
Threepio,"Sir, the possibility of successfully navigating an asteroid  field is approximately three thousand, seven hundred and twenty to one.",5,304
Han,Never tell me the odds!,5,305
Han,"You said you wanted to be around when I made a mistake; well,  this could be it, sweetheart.",5,306
Leia,I take it back. We're going to get pulverized if we stay out  here much longer.,5,307
Han,I'm not going to argue with that.,5,308
Threepio,Pulverized?,5,309
Han,I'm going in closer to one of the big ones.,5,310
Leia,Closer?,5,311
Threepio,Closer?!,5,312
Threepio,"Oh, this is suicide!",5,313
Han,There. That looks pretty good.,5,314
Leia,What looks pretty good?,5,315
Han,Yeah. That'll do nicely.,5,316
Threepio,"Excuse me, ma'am, but where are we going?",5,317
Leia,I hope you know what you're doing.,5,318
Han,"Yeah, me too.",5,319
Luke,"Yes, that's it. Dagobah.",5,320
Luke,"No, I'm not going to change my mind about this.   I'm not picking up any cities or technology. Massive life-form readings, though. There's something alive down there...",5,321
Luke,"Yes, I'm sure it's perfectly safe for droids.",5,322
Luke,"I know, I know! All the scopes are dead. I can't  see a thing! Just hang on, I'm going to start the landing cycle...",5,323
Luke,"No, Artoo, you stay put. I'll have a look around.",5,324
Luke,Artoo?,5,325
Luke,Artoo! Where are you?,5,326
Luke,Artoo! You be more careful.,5,327
Luke,Artoo -- that way!,5,328
Luke,Artoo!,5,329
Luke,"Oh, no! Are you all right? Come on. You're lucky you don't taste  very good. Anything broken?",5,330
Luke,"If you're saying coming here was a bad idea, I'm beginning to  agree with you. Oh, Artoo, what are we doing here? It's like... something out of a dream, or, I don't know. Maybe I'm just going crazy.",5,331
Vader,"Yes, Admiral?",5,332
Piett,"Our ships have sighted the Millennium Falcon, lord. But...it  has entered an asteroid field and we cannot risk...",5,333
Vader,"Asteroids do not concern me, Admiral. I want  that ship and not excuses.",5,334
Piett,"Yes, lord.",5,335
Han,I'm going to shut down everything but the emergency power  systems.,5,336
Threepio,"Sir, I'm almost afraid to ask, but...does that include  shutting me down, too?",5,337
Han,"No, I need you to talk to the Falcon, find out what's wrong with  the hyperdrive.",5,338
Threepio,"Sir, it's quite possible this asteroid is not entirely  stable.",5,339
Han,"Not entirely stable? I'm glad you're here to tell us these  things.  Chewie, take the professor in the back and plug him into the hyperdrive.",5,340
Threepio,"Oh! Sometimes I just don't understand human behavior. After  all, I'm only trying to do my job in the most...",5,341
Leia,Let go.,5,342
Han,Sshh!,5,343
Leia,"Let go, please.",5,344
Han,Don't get excited.,5,345
Leia,"Captain, being held by you isn't quite enough to get me excited.",5,346
Han,"Sorry, sweetheart. We haven't got time for anything else.",5,347
Luke,Ready for some power? Okay. Let's see now. Put that in there.  There you go.,5,348
Luke,Now all I have to do is find this Yoda...if he even  exists.,5,349
Luke,Still...there's something familiar about this place. I feel  like...I don't know...,5,350
Strange Voice,Feel like what?,5,351
Luke,Like we're being watched!,5,352
Creature,Away with your weapon! I mean you no harm.,5,353
Creature,"I am wondering, why are you here?",5,354
Luke,I'm looking for someone.,5,355
Creature,"Looking? Found someone, you have, I would say, hmmm?",5,356
Luke,Right.,5,357
Creature,"Help you I can. Yes, mmmm.",5,358
Luke,I don't think so. I'm looking for a great warrior.,5,359
Creature,Ahhh! A great warrior.  Wars not  make one great.,5,360
Luke,Put that down. Hey! That's my dinner.,5,361
Creature,"How you get so big, eating food of this kind?",5,362
Luke,"Listen, friend, we didn't mean to land in that puddle, and if we  could get our ship out, we would, but we can't, so why don't you just...",5,363
Creature,"Aww, cannot get your ship out?",5,364
Luke,"Hey, you could have broken this. Don't do that. Ohhh...you're  making a mess. Hey, give me that!",5,365
Creature,Mine! Or I will help you not.,5,366
Luke,I don't want your help. I want my lamp back. I'll need it to get  out of this slimy mudhole.,5,367
Creature,Mudhole? Slimy? My home this is.,5,368
Creature,"Ah, ah, ah!",5,369
Luke,"Oh, Artoo, let him have it.",5,370
Creature,Mine! Mine!,5,371
Luke,Artoo!,5,372
Creature,Mine!,5,373
Creature,Mine!,5,374
Luke,"Now will you move along, little fella? We're got a lot  of work to do.",5,375
Creature,"No! No, no! Stay and help you, I will.  Find your  friend, hmm?",5,376
Luke,"I'm not looking for a friend, I'm looking for a Jedi Master.",5,377
Creature,Oohhh. Jedi Master. Yoda. You seek Yoda.,5,378
Luke,You know him?,5,379
Creature,"Mmm. Take you to him, I will.  Yes, yes. But now, we  must eat. Come. Good food. Come.",5,380
Creature,"Come, come.",5,381
Luke,"Stay here and watch after the camp, Artoo.",5,382
Threepio,"Oh, where is Artoo when I need him?",5,383
Threepio,"Sir, I don't know where your ship learned to communicate,  but it has the most peculiar dialect. I believe, sir, it says that the power coupling on the negative axis has been polarized. I'm afraid you'll have to replace it.",5,384
Han,"Well, of course I'll have to replace it.",5,385
Han,Here! And Chewie...,5,386
Han,...I think we'd better replace the negative power  coupling.,5,387
Han,"Hey, Your Worship, I'm only trying to help.",5,388
Leia,Would you please stop calling me that?,5,389
Han,"Sure, Leia.",5,390
Leia,"Oh, you make it so difficult sometimes.",5,391
Han,"I do, I really do. You could be a little nicer, though.  Come on, admit it. Sometimes you think I'm all right.",5,392
Leia,Occasionally  maybe...when you aren't  acting like a scoundrel.,5,393
Han,Scoundrel? Scoundrel? I like the sound of that.,5,394
Leia,Stop that.,5,395
Han,Stop what?,5,396
Leia,Stop that! My hands are dirty.,5,397
Han,"My hands are dirty, too. What are you afraid of?",5,398
Leia,Afraid?,5,399
Han,You're trembling.,5,400
Leia,I'm not trembling.,5,401
Han,You like me because I'm a scoundrel. There aren't enough  scoundrels in your life.,5,402
Leia,I happen to like nice men.,5,403
Han,I'm a nice man.,5,404
Leia,"No, you're not. You're...",5,405
Threepio,"Sir, sir! I've isolated the reverse power flux coupling.",5,406
Han,Thank you. Thank you very much.,5,407
Threepio,"Oh, you're perfectly welcome, sir.",5,408
Needa,"...and that, Lord Vader, was the last time they  appeared in any of our scopes. Considering the amount of damage we've sustained, they must have been destroyed.",5,409
Vader,"No, Captain, they're alive. I want every ship available to  sweep the asteroid field until they are found.",5,410
Piett,Lord Vader.,5,411
Vader,"Yes, Admiral, what is it?",5,412
Piett,The Emperor commands you make contact with him.,5,413
Vader,Move the ship out of the asteroid field so that we can send a  clear transmission.,5,414
Piett,"Yes, my lord.",5,415
Vader,"What is thy bidding, my master?",5,416
Emperor,There is a great disturbance in the Force.,5,417
Vader,I have felt it.,5,418
Emperor,We have a new enemy -- Luke Skywalker.,5,419
Vader,"Yes, my master.",5,420
Emperor,He could destroy us.,5,421
Vader,He's just a boy. Obi-Wan can no longer help him.,5,422
Emperor,The Force is strong with him. The son of Skywalker must not  become a Jedi.,5,423
Vader,"If he could be turned, he would become a powerful ally.",5,424
Emperor,Yes. Yes. He would be a great asset. Can it be done?,5,425
Vader,"He will join us or die, my master.",5,426
Luke,"Look, I'm sure it's delicious. I just don't understand why we  can't see Yoda now.",5,427
Creature,"Patience! For the Jedi it is time to eat as well. Eat, eat.  Hot. Good food, hm? Good, hmm?",5,428
Luke,How far away is Yoda? Will it take us long to get there?,5,429
Creature,"Not far. Yoda not far. Patience. Soon you will be with him.   Rootleaf, I cook. Why wish you become Jedi? Hm?",5,430
Luke,"Mostly because of my father, I guess.",5,431
Creature,"Ah, your father. Powerful Jedi was he, powerful Jedi, mmm.",5,432
Luke,"Oh, come on. How could you know my father? You  don't even know who I am.  Oh, I don't even know what I'm doing here. We're wasting our time.",5,433
Creature,I cannot teach him. The boy has no patience.,5,434
Ben,He will learn patience.,5,435
Yoda,"Hmmm. Much anger in him, like his father.",5,436
Ben,Was I any different when you taught me?,5,437
Yoda,Hah. He is not ready.,5,438
Luke,"Yoda! I am ready. I...Ben! I can be a Jedi. Ben, tell him I'm  ready.",5,439
Yoda,"Ready, are you? What know you of ready? For eight hundred years  have I trained Jedi. My own counsel will I keep on who is to be trained! A Jedi must have the deepest commitment, the most serious mind.  This one a long time have I watched. Never his mind on where he was. Hmm? What he was doing. Hmph. Adventure. Heh! Excitement. Heh! A Jedi craves not these things.  You are reckless!",5,440
Ben,"So was I, if you'll remember.",5,441
Yoda,"He is too old. Yes, too old to begin the training.",5,442
Luke,But I've learned so much.,5,443
Yoda,Will he finished what he begins?,5,444
Luke,I won't fail you -- I'm not afraid.,5,445
Yoda,"Oh, you will be. You will be.",5,446
Threepio,"Sir, if I may venture an opinion...",5,447
Han,"I'm not really interested in your opinion, Threepio.",5,448
Leia,There's something out there.,5,449
Han,Where?,5,450
Leia,"Outside, in the cave.",5,451
Threepio,There it is. Listen! Listen!,5,452
Han,I'm going out there.,5,453
Leia,Are you crazy?!,5,454
Han,I just got this bucket back together. I'm not going to let  something tear it apart.,5,455
Leia,Then I'm going with you.,5,456
Threepio,"I think it might be better if I stay here and guard the  ship.  Oh, no.",5,457
Leia,This ground sure feels strange. It doesn't feel like rock at  all.,5,458
Han,There's an awful lot of moisture in here.,5,459
Leia,I don't know. I have a bad feeling about this.,5,460
Han,Yeah.,5,461
Han,Watch out!,5,462
Han,"Yeah, that's what I thought. Mynock. Chewie, check the rest of  the ship, make sure there aren't any more attached. They're chewing on the power cables.",5,463
Leia,Mynocks?,5,464
Han,Go on inside. We'll clean them off if there are any more.,5,465
Threepio,Ohhh! Go away! Go away! Beastly thing. Shoo! Shoo!,5,466
Han,Wait a minute...,5,467
Han,"All right, Chewie, let's get out of here!",5,468
Leia,The Empire is still out there. I don't think it's wise to...,5,469
Han,No time to discuss this as a committee.,5,470
Leia,I am not a committee!,5,471
Leia,You can't make the jump to light-speed in this asteroid field...,5,472
Han,"Sit down, sweetheart. We're taking off!",5,473
Threepio,Look!,5,474
Han,"I see it, I see it.",5,475
Threepio,We're doomed!,5,476
Leia,The cave is collapsing.,5,477
Han,This is no cave.,5,478
Leia,What?,5,479
Yoda,"Run! Yes. A Jedi's strength flows from the Force. But beware of  the dark side. Anger...fear...aggression. The dark side of the Force are they. Easily they flow, quick to join you in a fight. If once you start down the dark path, forever will it dominate your destiny, consume you it will, as it did Obi-Wan's apprentice.",5,480
Luke,Vader. Is the dark side stronger?,5,481
Yoda,"No...no...no. Quicker, easier, more seductive.",5,482
Luke,But how am I to know the good side from the bad?,5,483
Yoda,"You will know. When you are calm, at peace. Passive. A Jedi uses  the Force for knowledge and defense, never for attack.",5,484
Luke,But tell me why I can't...,5,485
Yoda,"No, no, there is no why. Nothing more will I  teach you today. Clear your mind of questions. Mmm. Mmmmmm.",5,486
Luke,There's something not right here.,5,487
Luke,"I feel cold, death.",5,488
Yoda,That place...is strong with the dark side of the Force. A domain  of evil it is. In you must go.,5,489
Luke,What's in there?,5,490
Yoda,Only what you take with you.,5,491
Yoda,Your weapons...you will not need them.,5,492
Piett,Bounty hunters. We don't need that scum.,5,493
First Controller,"Yes, sir.",5,494
Piett,Those Rebels won't escape us.,5,495
Second Controller,"Sir, we have a priority signal from the Star  Destroyer Avenger.",5,496
Piett,Right.,5,497
Vader,"...there will be a substantial reward for the one who finds  the Millennium Falcon. You are free to use any methods necessary, but I want them alive. No disintegrations.",5,498
Boba Fett,As you wish.,5,499
Piett,"Lord Vader! My lord, we have them.",5,500
Threepio,"Oh, thank goodness we're coming out of the asteroid field.",5,501
Han,Let's get out of here. Ready for light-speed? One...two...three!,5,502
Han,It's not fair!,5,503
Han,The transfer circuits are working. It's not my fault!,5,504
Leia,No light-speed?,5,505
Han,It's not my fault.,5,506
Threepio,"Sir, we just lost the main rear deflector shield. One more  direct hit on the back quarter and we're done for.",5,507
Han,Turn her around.,5,508
Han,I said turn her around! I'm going to put all power in the front  shield.,5,509
Leia,You're going to attack them?!,5,510
Threepio,"Sir, the odds of surviving a direct assault on an Imperial  Star Destroyer...",5,511
Leia,Shut up!,5,512
Needa,They're moving to attack position. Shields up!,5,513
Needa,"Track them,. They may come around for another pass.",5,514
Tracking Officer,"Captain Needa, the ship no longer appears on our  scopes.",5,515
Needa,They can't have disappeared. No ship that small has a cloaking  device.,5,516
Tracking Officer,"Well, there's no trace of them, sir.",5,517
Communications Officer,"Captain, Lord Vader demands an update on the  pursuit.",5,518
Needa,"Get a shuttle ready. I shall assume full  responsibility for losing them, and apologize to Lord Vader. Meanwhile, continue to scan the area.",5,519
Communications Officer,"Yes, Captain Needa.",5,520
Yoda,Use the Force. Yes...,5,521
Yoda,Now...the stone. Feel it.,5,522
Yoda,Concentrate!,5,523
Luke,"Oh, no. We'll never get it out now.",5,524
Yoda,So certain are you. Always with you it cannot be done. Hear you  nothing that I say?,5,525
Luke,"Master, moving stones around is one thing. This is totally  different.",5,526
Yoda,No! No different! Only different in your mind. You must unlearn  what you have learned.,5,527
Luke,"All right, I'll give it a try.",5,528
Yoda,No! Try not. Do. Or do not. There is no try.,5,529
Luke,I can't. It's too big.,5,530
Yoda,"Size matters not. Look at me. Judge me by my size, do you? Hm?  Mmmm.",5,531
Yoda,"And well you should not. For my ally in the Force. And a  powerful ally it is. Life creates it, makes it grow. It's energy surrounds us and binds us. Luminous beings are we......not this crude matter.  You must feel the Force around you.  Here, between you...me...the tree...the rock...everywhere! Yes, even between this land and that ship!",5,532
Luke,You want the impossible.,5,533
Luke,I don't...I don't believe it.,5,534
Yoda,That is why you fail.,5,535
Vader,"Apology accepted, Captain Needa.",5,536
Piett,"Lord Vader, our ships have completed their scan of the area and  found nothing. If the Millennium Falcon went into light-speed, it'll be on the other side of the galaxy by now.",5,537
Vader,Alert all commands. Calculate every possible destination along  their last know trajectory.,5,538
Piett,"Yes, my lord. We'll find them.",5,539
Vader,"Don't fail me again, Admiral.",5,540
Piett,Alert all commands. Deploy the fleet.,5,541
Threepio,"Captain Solo, this time you have gone too far.  No, I will not be quiet, Chewbacca. Why doesn't anyone listen to me?",5,542
Han,The fleet is beginning to break up. Go back and stand  by the manual release for the landing claw.,5,543
Threepio,I really don't see how thats going to help. Surrender is a  perfectly acceptable alternative in extreme circumstances. The Empire may be gracious enough...,5,544
Han,Thank you.,5,545
Leia,What did you have in mind for your next move?,5,546
Han,"Well, if they follow standard Imperial procedure, they'll dump  their garbage before they go to light-speed, then we just float away.",5,547
Leia,With the rest of the garbage. Then what?,5,548
Han,Then we've got to find a safe port somewhere around here. Got any  ideas?,5,549
Leia,No. Where are we?,5,550
Han,The Anoat system.,5,551
Leia,Anoat system. There's not much there.,5,552
Han,"No. Well, wait. This is interesting. Lando.",5,553
Leia,Lando system?,5,554
Han,"Lando's not a system, he's a man. Lando Calrissian. He's a card  player, gambler, scoundrel. You'd like him.",5,555
Leia,Thanks.,5,556
Han,"Bespin. It's pretty far, but I think we can make it.",5,557
Leia,A mining colony?,5,558
Han,"Yeah, a Tibanna gas mine. Lando conned somebody out of it. We go  back a long way, Lando and me.",5,559
Leia,Can you trust him?,5,560
Han,"No. But he has no love for the Empire, I can tell you that.",5,561
Han,"Here we go, Chewie. Stand by. Detach!",5,562
Leia,"You do have your moments. Not many, but you have them.",5,563
Yoda,"Concentrate...feel the Force flow. Yes. Good. Calm, yes. Through  the Force, things you will see. Other places. The future...the past. Old friends long gone.",5,564
Luke,Han! Leia!,5,565
Yoda,"Hmm. Control, control. You must learn control.",5,566
Luke,I saw...I saw a city in the clouds.,5,567
Yoda,Mmm. Friends you have there.,5,568
Luke,They were in pain.,5,569
Yoda,It is the future you see.,5,570
Luke,Future? Will they die?,5,571
Yoda,Difficult to see. Always in motion is the future.,5,572
Luke,I've got to go to them.,5,573
Yoda,"Decide you must how to serve them best. If you leave now, help  them you could. But you would destroy all for which they have fought and suffered.",5,574
Han,"No, I don't have a landing permit. I'm trying  to reach Lando Calrissian.",5,575
Han,Whoa! Wait a minute! Let me explain.,5,576
Intercom Voice,You will not deviate from your present course.,5,577
Threepio,"Rather touchy, aren't they?",5,578
Leia,I thought you knew this person.,5,579
Han,"Well, that was a long time ago. I'm sure he's  forgotten about that.",5,580
Intercom Voice,Permission granted to land on Platform  Three-two-seven.,5,581
Han,Thank you.,5,582
Han,"There's nothing to worry about. We go way back, Lando and me.",5,583
Leia,Who's worried?,5,584
Threepio,Oh. No one to meet us.,5,585
Leia,I don't like this.,5,586
Han,"Well, what would you like?",5,587
Threepio,"Well, they did let us land.",5,588
Han,"Look, don't worry. Everything's going to be fine. Trust me.",5,589
Han,"See? My friend.  Keep your eyes open, okay?",5,590
Lando,"Why, you slimy, double-crossing, no-good swindler! You've got a  lot of guts coming here, after what you pulled.",5,591
Lando,"How you doing, you old pirate? So good to see you! I  never thought I'd catch up with you again. Where you been?",5,592
Threepio,"Well, he seems very friendly.",5,593
Leia,Yes...very friendly.,5,594
Lando,What are you doing here?,5,595
Han,Ahh...repairs. I thought you could  help me out.,5,596
Lando,What have you done to my ship?,5,597
Han,"Your ship? Hey, remember, you lost her to me fair and square.",5,598
Lando,Hello. What have we here? Welcome. I'm Lando Calrissian. I'm  the administrator of this facility. and who might you be?,5,599
Leia,Leia.,5,600
Lando,"Welcome, Leia.",5,601
Han,"All right, all right, you old smoothie.",5,602
Threepio,"Hello, sir. I am See-Threepio, human-cyborg relations. My  facilities are at your...",5,603
Threepio,"Well, really!",5,604
Lando,What's wrong with the Falcon?,5,605
Han,Hyperdrive.,5,606
Lando,I'll get my people to work on it.,5,607
Han,Good.,5,608
Lando,"You know, that ship saved my life quite a few times. She's the  fastest hunk of junk in the galaxy.",5,609
Han,How's the gas mine? Is it paying off for you?,5,610
Lando,"Oh, not as well as I'd like. We're a small outpost and not very  self-sufficient. And I've had supply problems of every kind. I've had labor difficulties... What's so funny?",5,611
Han,"You. Listen to you -- you sound like a businessman, a responsible  leader. Who'd have thought that, huh?",5,612
Lando,"You know, seeing you sure brings back a few things.",5,613
Han,Yeah.,5,614
Lando,"Yeah, I'm responsible these days. It's the  price you pay for being successful.",5,615
Threepio,Oh! Nice to see a familiar face.,5,616
Second Threepio,E chu ta!,5,617
Threepio,How rude!,5,618
Threepio,That sounds like an R2 unit in there. I wonder if...,5,619
Threepio,"Hello? How interesting. Oh, my.",5,620
Man,Who are you?,5,621
Threepio,"Oh, I'm terribly sorry. I...I didn't mean to intrude. No,  no, please don't get up. No!",5,622
Yoda,Luke! You must complete the training.,5,623
Luke,I can't keep the vision out of my head. They're my friends. I've  got to help them.,5,624
Yoda,You must not go!,5,625
Luke,But Han and Leia will die if I don't.,5,626
Ben,You don't know that.,5,627
Ben,Even Yoda cannot see their fate.,5,628
Luke,But I can help them! I feel the Force!,5,629
Ben,"But you cannot control it. This is a dangerous time for you, when  you will be tempted by the dark side of the Force.",5,630
Yoda,"Yes, yes. To Obi-Wan you listen. The cave. Remember your failure  at the cave!",5,631
Luke,"But I've learned so much since then. Master Yoda, I promise to  return and finish what I've begun. You have my word.",5,632
Ben,It is you and your abilities the Emperor wants. that is why your  friends are made to suffer.,5,633
Luke,And that is why I have to go.,5,634
Ben,"Luke, I don't want to lose you to the Emperor the way I lost  Vader.",5,635
Luke,You won't.,5,636
Yoda,"Stopped they must be. On this depends. Only a fully trained Jedi  Knight with the Force as his ally will conquer Vader and his Emperor. If you end your training now, if you choose the quick and easy path, as Vader did, you will become an agent of evil.",5,637
Ben,Patience.,5,638
Luke,And sacrifice Han and Leia?,5,639
Yoda,If you honor what they fight for...yes!,5,640
Ben,"If you choose to face Vader, you will do it alone. I cannot  interfere.",5,641
Luke,"I understand.  Artoo, fire up the  converters.",5,642
Ben,"Luke, don't give in to hate -- that leads to the dark side.",5,643
Yoda,Strong is Vader. Mind what you have learned. Save you it can.,5,644
Luke,I will. And I'll return. I promise.,5,645
Yoda,"Told you, I did. Reckless is he. Now matters are worse.",5,646
Ben,That boy is our last hope.,5,647
Yoda,No. There is another.,5,648
Han,The ship is almost finished. Two or Three more things and we're  in great shape.,5,649
Leia,The sooner the better. Something's wrong here. No one has seen  or knows anything about Threepio. He's been gone too long to have gotten lost.,5,650
Han,Relax. I'll talk to Lando and see what I can find out.,5,651
Leia,I don't trust Lando.,5,652
Han,"Well, I don't trust him, either. But he is my friend. Besides,  we'll soon be gone.",5,653
Leia,"And then you're as good as gone, aren't you?",5,654
Leia,What happened?,5,655
Han,Where? Found him in a junk pile?,5,656
Leia,"Oh, what a mess. Chewie, do you think you can repair him?",5,657
Han,Lando's got people who can fix him.,5,658
Leia,"No, thanks.",5,659
Lando,I'm sorry. Am I interrupting anything?,5,660
Leia,Not really.,5,661
Lando,You look absolutely beautiful. You truly belong here with us  among the clouds.,5,662
Leia,Thank you.,5,663
Lando,Will you join me for a little refreshment?,5,664
Lando,"Everyone's invited, of course.",5,665
Lando,Having trouble with you droid?,5,666
Han,No. No problem. Why?,5,667
Lando,"So you see, since we're a small operation, we don't fall into  the...uh...jurisdiction of the Empire.",5,668
Leia,So you're part of the mining guild then?,5,669
Lando,"No, not actually. Our operation is small enough not to be  noticed...which is advantageous for everybody since our customers are anxious to avoid attracting attention to themselves.",5,670
Han,Aren't you afraid the Empire's going to find out about this  little operation and shut you down?,5,671
Lando,That's always been a danger looming like a shadow over  everything we've built here. But things have developed that will insure security. I've just made a deal that will keep the Empire out of here forever.,5,672
Vader,We would be honored if you would join us.,5,673
Lando,I had no choice. They arrived right before you did. I'm sorry.,5,674
Han,"I'm sorry, too.",5,675
Luke,"No, Threepio's with them.",5,676
Luke,Just hang on. We're almost there.,5,677
Threepio,"Mmmm. Oh, my. Uh, I, uh -- Take this off! I, uh, don't mean  to intrude here. I, don't, no, no, no...Please don't get up. No!",5,678
Threepio,"Stormtroopers? Here? We're in danger. I must tell the  others. Oh, no! I've been shot!",5,679
Lando,Lord Vader.,5,680
Vader,You may take Captain Solo to Jabba the Hut after I  have Skywalker.,5,681
Boba Fett,He's no good to me dead.,5,682
Vader,He will not be permanently damaged.,5,683
Lando,"Lord Vader, what about Leia and the Wookiee?",5,684
Vader,They must never again leave this city.,5,685
Lando,"That was never a condition of our agreement, nor was giving Han  to this bounty hunter!",5,686
Vader,Perhaps you think you're being treated unfairly.,5,687
Lando,No.,5,688
Vader,Good. It would be unfortunate if I had to leave a garrison  here.,5,689
Lando,This deal's getting worse all the time.,5,690
Threepio,"Oh, yes, that's very good. I like that. Oh! Something's not  right because now I can't see. Wait. Wait! Oh, my! what have you done? I'm backwards, you stupid furball. Only an overgrown mophead like you would be stupid enough...",5,691
Han,I feel terrible.,5,692
Leia,Why are they doing this?,5,693
Han,They never even asked me any questions.,5,694
Leia,Lando.,5,695
Han,"Get out of here, Lando!",5,696
Lando,Shut up and listen! Vader has agreed to turn Leia and Chewie  over to me.,5,697
Han,Over to you?,5,698
Lando,"They'll have to stay here, but at least they'll be safe.",5,699
Leia,What about Han?,5,700
Lando,Vader's giving him to the bounty hunter.,5,701
Leia,Vader wants us all dead.,5,702
Lando,He doesn't want you at all. He's after somebody called  Skywalker.,5,703
Han,Luke?,5,704
Lando,Lord Vader has set a trap for him.,5,705
Leia,And we're the bait.,5,706
Lando,"Well, he's on his way.",5,707
Han,"Perfect. You fixed us all pretty good, didn't you?   My friend!",5,708
Lando,"Stop! I've done all I can do. I'm sorry I couldn't do better,  but I have my own problems.",5,709
Han,"Yeah, you're a real hero.",5,710
Leia,You certainly have a way with people.,5,711
Vader,"This facility is crude, but it should be adequate to freeze  Skywalker for his journey to the Emperor.",5,712
Imperial Soldier,"Lord Vader, ship approaching. X-wing class.",5,713
Vader,Good. Monitor Skywalker and allow him to land.,5,714
Lando,"Lord Vader, we only use this facility for carbon freezing. If  you put him in there, it might kill him.",5,715
Vader,I do not want the Emperor's prize damaged. We will test it...on  Captain Solo.,5,716
Threepio,"If only you had attached my legs, I wouldn't be in this  ridiculous position. Now, remember, Chewbacca, you have a responsibility to me, so don't do anything foolish.",5,717
Han,What's going on...buddy?,5,718
Lando,You're being put into carbon freeze.,5,719
Boba Fett,What if he doesn't survive? He's worth a lot to me.,5,720
Vader,The Empire will compensate you if he dies. Put him in!,5,721
Threepio,"Oh, no! No, no, no! Stop, Chewbacca, stop...!",5,722
Han,"Stop, Chewie, stop! Do you hear me? Stop!",5,723
Threepio,"Yes, stop, please! I'm not ready to die.",5,724
Han,"Chewie! Chewie, this won't help me. Hey!",5,725
Han,Save your strength. There'll be another time. The princess -- you  have to take care of her. You hear me?,5,726
Leia,I love you!,5,727
Han,I know.,5,728
Threepio,"What...what's going on? Turn around, Chewbacca, I can't see.  Oh...they've encased him in carbonite. He should be quite well-protected -- if he survives the freezing process, that is.",5,729
Vader,"Well, Calrissian, did he survive?",5,730
Lando,"Yes, he's alive. And in perfect hibernation.",5,731
Vader,He's all yours bounty hunter. Reset the chamber for Skywalker.,5,732
Imperial Officer,"Skywalker has just landed, my lord.",5,733
Vader,"Good. See to it that he finds his way here. Calrissian, take  the princess and the Wookiee to my ship.",5,734
Lando,You said they'd be left in the city under my supervision.,5,735
Vader,I am altering the deal. Pray I don't alter it any further.,5,736
Leia,"Luke! Luke, don't -- it's a trap! It's a trap!",5,737
Vader,"The Force is with you, young Skywalker. But you are not a Jedi  yet.",5,738
Lando,Well done. Hold them in the security tower -- and keep it  quiet. Move.,5,739
Leia,What do you think you're doing?,5,740
Lando,We're getting out of here.,5,741
Threepio,I knew all along it had to be a mistake.,5,742
Leia,Do you think that after what you did to Han we're going to trust  you?,5,743
Lando,I had no choice...,5,744
Threepio,"What are you doing? Trust him, trust him!",5,745
Leia,"Oh, so we understand, don't we, Chewie? He had no choice.",5,746
Lando,I'm just trying to help...,5,747
Leia,We don't need any of your help.,5,748
Lando,H-a-a-a...,5,749
Leia,What?,5,750
Threepio,It sounds like Han.,5,751
Lando,"There's still a chance to save Han...I mean, at the East  Platform...",5,752
Leia,Chewie.,5,753
Threepio,"I'm terribly sorry about all this. After all,  he's only a Wookiee.",5,754
Boba Fett,Put Captain Solo in the cargo hold.,5,755
Threepio,Artoo! Artoo! Where have you been?,5,756
Threepio,"Turn around, you wooly...!  Hurry, hurry! We're  trying to save Han from the bounty hunter!",5,757
Threepio,"Well, at least your still in one piece! Look what happened  to me!",5,758
Threepio,"Oh, no! Chewie, they're behind you!",5,759
Vader,"You have learned much, young one.",5,760
Luke,You'll find I'm full of surprises.,5,761
Vader,"Your destiny lies with me, Skywalker. Obi-Wan knew this to be  true.",5,762
Luke,No!,5,763
Vader,All to easy. Perhaps you are not as strong as the Emperor  thought.,5,764
Vader,Impressive...most impressive.,5,765
Vader,Obi-Wan has taught you well. You have controlled your fear...  now release your anger.,5,766
Vader,Only your hatred can destroy me.,5,767
Lando,The security codes has been changed!,5,768
Threepio,"Artoo, you can tell the computer to override the security  system.",5,769
Lando,Attention! This is Lando Calrissian. The Empire has takes  control of the city. I advise everyone to leave before more Imperial troops arrive.,5,770
Lando,This way.,5,771
Threepio,Don't blame me. I'm an interpreter. I'm not supposed to know  a power socket from a computer terminal.,5,772
Threepio,"What are you talking about? We're not interested in the  hyperdrive on the Millennium Falcon. It's fixed! Just open the door, you stupid lump.",5,773
Threepio,I never doubted you for a second. Wonderful!,5,774
Threepio,"Ouch! Oh! Ah! That hurt, Bend down, you thoughtless...Ow!",5,775
Lando,Leia! Go!,5,776
Threepio,"I thought that hairy beast would be the end of me. Of  course, I've looked better.",5,777
Vader,You are beaten. It is useless to resist. Don't let yourself be  destroyed as Obi-Wan did.,5,778
Vader,"There is no escape. Don't make me destroy you. You do not yet  realize your importance. You have only begun to discover you power. Join me and I will complete your training. With our combined strength, we can end this destructive conflict and bring order to the galaxy.",5,779
Luke,I'll never join you!,5,780
Vader,If you only knew the power of the dark side. Obi-Wan never told  you what happened to your father.,5,781
Luke,He told me enough! He told me you killed him.,5,782
Vader,No. I am your father.,5,783
Luke,No. No. That's not true! That's impossible!,5,784
Vader,Search your feelings. You know it to be true.,5,785
Luke,No! No! No!,5,786
Vader,"Luke. You can destroy the Emperor. He has foreseen this. It is  your destiny. Join me, and we can rule the galaxy as father and son. Come with me. It's the only way.",5,787
Luke,"Ben...Ben, please!",5,788
Luke,Ben. Leia!,5,789
Luke,Hear me! Leia!,5,790
Leia,Luke...We've got to go back.,5,791
Lando,What?,5,792
Leia,I know where Luke is.,5,793
Lando,But what about those fighter?,5,794
Leia,"Chewie, just do it.",5,795
Lando,But what about Vader?,5,796
Lando,"All right, all right, all right.",5,797
Vader,Bring my shuttle.,5,798
Lando,"Look, someone's up there.",5,799
Leia,"It's Luke. Chewie, slow down. Slow down and we'll get under him.  Lando, open the top hatch.",5,800
Leia,"Okay. Easy, Chewie.",5,801
Leia,Lando?,5,802
Lando,"Okay, let's go.",5,803
Luke,"Oh, Leia.",5,804
Lando,"All right, Chewie. Let's go.",5,805
Leia,I'll be back.,5,806
Leia,Star Destroyer.,5,807
Lando,"All right, Chewie. Ready for light-speed.",5,808
Leia,If your people fixed the hyperdrive.,5,809
Leia,All the coordinates are set. It's now or never.,5,810
Lando,Punch it!,5,811
Lando,They told me they fixed it. I trusted them to fix it. It's not  my fault!,5,812
Piett,"They'll be in range of our tractor beam in moments, lord.",5,813
Vader,Did your men deactivate the hyperdrive on the Millennium  Falcon?,5,814
Piett,"Yes, my lord.",5,815
Vader,Good. Prepare the boarding party and set for your weapons for  stun.,5,816
Piett,"Yes, my lord.",5,817
Threepio,Noisy brute. Why don't we just go into light-speed?,5,818
Threepio,We can't? How would you know the hyperdrive is deactivated?,5,819
Threepio,"The city's central computer told you? Artoo-Detoo, you know  better than to trust a strange computer. Ouch! Pay attention to what you're doing!",5,820
Vader,Luke.,5,821
Luke,Father.,5,822
Vader,"Son, come with me.",5,823
Luke,"Ben, why didn't you tell me?",5,824
Lando,Chewie!,5,825
Luke,It's Vader.,5,826
Vader,Luke...it is your destiny.,5,827
Luke,"Ben, why didn't you tell me?",5,828
Piett,Alert all commands. Ready for the tractor beam.,5,829
Threepio,"Artoo, come back at once! You haven't finished with me yet!  You don't know how to fix the hyperdrive. Chewbacca can do it. I'm standing here in pieces, and you're having delusions of grandeur!",5,830
Threepio,"Oh, you did it!",5,831
Lando,"Luke, we're ready for takeoff.",5,832
Luke,"Good luck, Lando",5,833
Lando,"When we find Jabba the Hut and that bounty  hunter, we'll contact you.",5,834
Luke,I'll meet you at the rendezvous point on  Tatooine.,5,835
Lando,"Princess, we'll find Han. I promise.",5,836
Luke,"Chewie, I'll be waiting for your signal.",5,837
Luke,"Take care, you two. May the Force be with you.",5,838
Luke,Ow!,5,839
Shuttle Captain,"Command station, this is ST 321. Code Clearance Blue. We're starting our approach. Deactivate the security shield.",6,1
Death Star Controller,The security deflector shield will be deactivated when we have confirmation of your code transmission. Stand by... You are clear to proceed.,6,2
Shuttle Captain,We're starting our approach.,6,3
Officer,Inform the commander that Lord Vader's shuttle has arrived.,6,4
Operator,"Yes, sir.",6,5
Jerjerrod,"Lord Vader, this is an unexpected pleasure.  We're honored by your presence.",6,6
Vader,"You may dispense with the pleasantries, Commander. I'm here to put you back on schedule.",6,7
Jerjerrod,"I assure you, Lord Vader, my men are working as fast as they can.",6,8
Vader,Perhaps I can find new ways to motivate them.,6,9
Jerjerrod,"I tell you, this station will be operational as planned.",6,10
Vader,The Emperor does not share your optimistic appraisal of the situation.,6,11
Jerjerrod,But he asks the impossible. I need more men.,6,12
Vader,Then perhaps you can tell him when he arrives.,6,13
Jerjerrod,The Emperor's coming here?,6,14
Vader,"That is correct, Commander. And he is most displeased with your apparent lack of progress.",6,15
Jerjerrod,We shall double our efforts.,6,16
Vader,"I hope so, Commander, for your sake. The Emperor is not as forgiving as I am.",6,17
Threepio,"Of course I'm worried. And you should be, too. Lando Calrissian and poor Chewbacca never returned from this awful place.",6,18
Threepio,"Don't be so sure. If I told you half the things I've heard about this Jabba the Hutt, You'd probably short-circuit.",6,19
Threepio,"Artoo, are you sure this is the right place? I better knock, I suppose.",6,20
Threepio,There doesn't seem to be anyone there. Let's go back and tell Master Luke.,6,21
Strange Voice,Tee chuta hhat yudd!,6,22
Threepio,Goodness gracious me!,6,23
Threepio,Artoo Detoowha bo Seethreepiowha ey toota odd mischka Jabba du Hutt.,6,24
Threepio,"I don't think they're going to let us in, Artoo. We'd better go.",6,25
Threepio,"Artoo, wait. Oh, dear! Artoo. Artoo, I really don't think we should rush into all this.",6,26
Threepio,"Oh, Artoo!  Artoo, wait for me!",6,27
Threepio,"Just you deliver Master Luke's message and get us out of here. Oh my! Oh! Oh, no.",6,28
Bib,Die Wanna Wanga!,6,29
Threepio,"Oh, my! Die Wanna Wauaga. We -- we bring a message to your master, Jabba the Hutt.",6,30
Threepio,"... and a gift.  Gift, what gift?",6,31
Bib,Nee Jabba no badda. Me chaade su goodie.,6,32
Threepio,He says that our instructions are to give it only to Jabba himself.,6,33
Threepio,I'm terribly sorry. I'm afraid he's ever so stubborn about these sort of things.,6,34
Bib,Nudd Chaa.,6,35
Threepio,"Artoo, I have a bad feeling about this.",6,36
Threepio,Good morning.,6,37
Jabba,Bo Shuda!,6,38
Threepio,"The message, Artoo, the message.",6,39
Luke,"Greetings, Exalted One. Allow me to introduce myself. I am Luke Skywalker, Jedi Knight and friend to Captain Solo. I know that you are powerful, mighty Jabba, and that your anger with Solo must be equally powerful. I seek an audience with Your Greatness to bargain for Solo's life.  With your wisdom, I'm sure that we can work out an arrangement which will be mutually beneficial and enable us to avoid any unpleasant confrontation. As a token of my goodwill, I present to you a gift: these two droids.",6,40
Threepio,What did he say?,6,41
Luke,... Both are hardworking and will serve you well.,6,42
Threepio,"This can't be! Artoo, you're playing the wrong message.",6,43
Jabba,There will be no bargain.,6,44
Threepio,We're doomed.,6,45
Jabba,I will not give up my favorite decoration. I like Captain Solo where he is.,6,46
Threepio,"Artoo, look! Captain Solo. And he's still frozen in carbonite.",6,47
Threepio,What could possibly have come over Master Luke. Is it something I did? He never expressed any unhappiness with my work. Oh! Oh! Hold it! Ohh!,6,48
Ninedenine,"Ah, good. New acquisitions. You are a protocol droid, are you not?",6,49
Threepio,"I am See-Threepio, human-cy...",6,50
Ninedenine,Yes or no will do.,6,51
Threepio,"Oh. Well, yes.",6,52
Ninedenine,How many languages do you speak?,6,53
Threepio,"I am fluent in over six million forms of communication, and can readily...",6,54
Ninedenine,Splendid! We have been without an interpreter since our master got angry with our last protocol droid and disintegrated him.,6,55
Threepio,Disintegrated?,6,56
Ninedenine,Guard! This protocol droid might be useful. Fit him with a restraining bolt and take him back to His Excellency's main audience chamber.,6,57
Threepio,"Artoo, don't leave me! Ohhh!",6,58
Ninedenine,"You're a feisty little one, but you'll soon learn some respect. I have need for you on the master's Sail Barge. And I think you'll fit in nicely.",6,59
Jabba,Da Eitha!,6,60
Oola,Na Chuba negatorie Na! Na! Natoota...,6,61
Jabba,Boscka!,6,62
Boushh,I have come for the bounty on this Wookiee.,6,63
Threepio,"Oh, no! Chewbacca!",6,64
Jabba,At last we have the mighty Chewbacca.,6,65
Threepio,"Oh, uh, yes, uh, I am here, Your Worshipfulness. Uh... yes!",6,66
Threepio,Oh. The illustrious Jabba bids you welcome and will gladly pay you the reward of twenty- five thousand.,6,67
Boushh,I want fifty thousand. No less.,6,68
Threepio,"Uh, oh... but what, what did I say?  Uh, the mighty Jabba asks why he must pay fifty thousand.",6,69
Threepio,Because he's holding a thermal detonator.,6,70
Jabba,This bounty hunter is my kind of scum. Fearless and inventive.,6,71
Threepio,Jabba offers the sum of thirty-five. And I suggest you take it.,6,72
Boushh,Zeebuss.,6,73
Threepio,He agrees!,6,74
Boushh,Just relax for a moment. You're free of the carbonite.,6,75
Boushh,Shhh. You have hibernation sickness.,6,76
Han,I can't see.,6,77
Boushh,You eyesight will return in time.,6,78
Han,Where am I?,6,79
Boushh,Jabba's palace.,6,80
Han,Who are you?,6,81
Leia,Someone who loves you.,6,82
Han,Leia!,6,83
Leia,I gotta get you out of here.,6,84
Han,What's that? I know that laugh.,6,85
Han,"Hey, Jabba. Look, Jabba, I was just on my way to pay you back, but I got a little sidetracked. It's not my fault.",6,86
Jabba,"It's too late for that, Solo. You may have been a good smuggler, but now you're Bantha fodder.",6,87
Han,Look...,6,88
Jabba,Take him away!,6,89
Han,Jabba... I'll pay you triple! You're throwing away a fortune here. Don't be a fool!,6,90
Jabba,Bring her to me.,6,91
Leia,We have powerful friends. You're gonna regret this...,6,92
Jabba,I'm sure.,6,93
Leia,Ugh!,6,94
Threepio,"Ohhh, I can't bear to watch.",6,95
Han,"Chewie? Chewie, is that you?",6,96
Han,Ah! Chew--Chewie!,6,97
Han,"Wait. I can't see, pal. What's goin' on?",6,98
Han,"Luke? Luke's crazy. He can't even take care of himself, much less rescue anybody.",6,99
Han,"A...Jedi Knight? I--I'm out of it for a little while, everybody gets delusions of grandeur.",6,100
Han,"I'm all right, pal. I'm all right.",6,101
Luke,I must speak with Jabba.,6,102
Luke,You will take me to Jabba now!,6,103
Luke,You serve your master well.,6,104
Luke,And you will be rewarded.,6,105
Threepio,At last! Master Luke's come to rescue me.,6,106
Bib,Master.,6,107
Bib,"...Luke Skywalker, Jedi Knight.",6,108
Jabba,I told you not to admit him.,6,109
Luke,I must be allowed to speak.,6,110
Bib,He must be allowed to speak.,6,111
Jabba,You weak-minded fool! He's using an old Jedi mind trick.,6,112
Luke,You will bring Captain Solo and the Wookiee to me.,6,113
Jabba,"Your mind powers will not work on me, boy.",6,114
Luke,"Nevertheless, I'm taking Captain Solo and his friends. You can either profit by this... or be destroyed! It's your choice. But I warn you not to underestimate my powers.",6,115
Threepio,"Master Luke, you're standing on...",6,116
Jabba,"There will be no bargain, young Jedi. I shall enjoy watching you die.",6,117
Jabba,Bascka!,6,118
Threepio,"Oh, no! The Rancor!",6,119
Jabba,Bring me Solo and the Wookiee. They will all suffer for this outrage.,6,120
Luke,Han!,6,121
Han,Luke!,6,122
Luke,Are you all right?,6,123
Han,"Fine. Together again, huh?",6,124
Luke,Wouldn't miss it.,6,125
Han,How are we doing?,6,126
Luke,The same as always.,6,127
Han,"That bad, huh? Where's Leia?",6,128
Leia,I'm here.,6,129
Threepio,"Oh, dear. His High Exaltedness, the great Jabba the Hutt, has decreed that you are to be terminated immediately.",6,130
Han,"Good, I hate long waits.",6,131
Threepio,"You will therefore be taken to the Dune Sea and cast into the pit of Carkoon, the nesting place of the all-powerful Sarlacc.",6,132
Han,Doesn't sound so bad.,6,133
Threepio,"In his belly, you will find a new definition of pain and suffering, as you are slowly digested over a thousand years.",6,134
Han,"On second thought, let's pass on that, huh?",6,135
Luke,"You should have bargained, Jabba. That's the last mistake you'll ever make.",6,136
Han,"I think my eyes are getting better. Instead of a big dark blur, I see a big light blur.",6,137
Luke,"There's nothing to see. I used to live here, you know.",6,138
Han,"You're gonna die here, you know. Convenient.",6,139
Luke,Just stick close to Chewie and Lando. I've taken care of everything.,6,140
Han,Oh... great!,6,141
Jabba,Soon you will learn to appreciate me.,6,142
Threepio,"Oh, I'm terribly sor... Artoo! What are you doing here?",6,143
Threepio,"Well, I can see you're serving drinks, but this place is dangerous. They're going to execute Master Luke and, if we're not careful, us too!",6,144
Threepio,Hmm.  I wish I had your confidence.,6,145
Threepio,"Victims of the almighty Sarlacc: His Excellency hopes that you will die honorably. But should any of you wish to beg for mercy, the great Jabba the Hutt will now listen to your pleas.",6,146
Han,"Threepio, you tell that slimy piece of... worm-ridden filth he'll get no such pleasure from us. Right?",6,147
Luke,Jabba! This is your last chance. Free us or die.,6,148
Jabba,Move him into position.,6,149
Jabba,Put him in.,6,150
Luke,"Easy, Chewie.",6,151
Lando,Whoa! Whoa! Help!,6,152
Han,"Chewie, you okay? Where is he?",6,153
Han,"I'm okay, pal.",6,154
Lando,Han! Chewie?,6,155
Han,Lando!,6,156
Han,Boba Fett?! Boba Fett?! Where?,6,157
Han,"Lando, grab it!",6,158
Lando,Lower it!,6,159
Han,I'm trying!,6,160
Han,"Whoa! Whoa! Grab me, Chewie! I'm slipping.",6,161
Han,Grab it! L--Lando. Grab!,6,162
Han,Grab it! Almost... You almost got it!,6,163
Lando,Hold it! Whoa!,6,164
Han,"Gently now. All... all right. Now easy, easy. Hold me, Chewie.",6,165
Han,"Chewie! Chewie, give me the gun. Don't move, Lando.",6,166
Lando,"No, wait! I thought you were blind!",6,167
Han,It's all right. Trust me. Don't move.,6,168
Lando,All right! A little higher! Just a little higher!,6,169
Han,"Chewie, Pull us up! Come on! Okay... up, Chewie, up!",6,170
Leia,Come on. We gotta get out of here quick.,6,171
Threepio,"Not my eyes! Artoo, help! Quickly, Artoo. Oh! Ohhh! You beast!",6,172
Luke,Get the gun! Point it at the deck!,6,173
Luke,Point it at the deck!,6,174
Threepio,"Artoo, where are we going? I couldn't possibly jump.",6,175
Luke,Come on!,6,176
Luke,Let's go! And don't forget the droids.,6,177
Lando,We're on our way.,6,178
Han,I don't know. All I can see is a lot of blowing sand!,6,179
Leia,That's all any of us can see.,6,180
Han,Then I guess I'm getting better.,6,181
Han,"I've got to hand it to you, kid, you were pretty good out there.",6,182
Luke,I had a lot of help. Think nothing of it.,6,183
Han,"No, I'm thinking a lot about it. That carbon freeze was the closest thing to dead there is. And it wasn't just sleepin'. It was a big wide awake nothing!",6,184
Luke,I'll see you back at the fleet.,6,185
Han,Why don't you leave that crate and come with us?,6,186
Luke,I have a promise I have to keep first... to an old friend.,6,187
Han,"Guess I owe you some thanks, too, Lando.",6,188
Lando,"Figured if I left you frozen like that you'd just give me bad luck the rest of my life, so I might as well get you unfrozen sooner or later.",6,189
Leia,"He means ""You're welcome.""",6,190
Lando,"Come on, let's get off this miserable dust ball.",6,191
Luke,I'll meet you back at the fleet.,6,192
Leia,Hurry. The Alliance should be assembled by now.,6,193
Luke,I will.,6,194
Han,"Hey, Luke, thanks. Thanks for comin' after me. Now I owe you one.",6,195
Luke,"That's right, Artoo. We're going to the  Dagobah system. I have a promise to keep...  to an old friend.",6,196
Emperor,"Rise, my friend.",6,197
Vader,The Death Star will be completed on schedule.,6,198
Emperor,"You have done well, Lord Vader. And now I sense you wish to continue your search for young Skywalker.",6,199
Vader,"Yes, my Master.",6,200
Emperor,"Patience, my friend. In time he will seek you out. And when he does, you must bring him before me. He has grown strong. Only together can we turn him to the dark side of the Force.",6,201
Vader,As you wish.,6,202
Emperor,Everything is proceeding as I have foreseen.,6,203
Yoda,Hmm. That face you make. Look I so old to young eyes?,6,204
Luke,No... of course not.,6,205
Yoda,"I do, yes, I do!  Sick have I become. Old and weak.  When nine hundred years old you reach, look as good you will not. Hmm?",6,206
Yoda,"Soon will I rest. Yes, forever sleep. Earned it, I have.",6,207
Luke,"Master Yoda, you can't die.",6,208
Yoda,Strong am I with the Force... but not that strong! Twilight is upon me and soon night must fall. That is the way of things ... the way of the Force.,6,209
Luke,But I need your help. I've come back to complete the training.,6,210
Yoda,No more training do you require. Already know you that which you need.,6,211
Luke,Then I am a Jedi?,6,212
Yoda,"Ohhh. Not yet. One thing remains: Vader. You must confront Vader. Then, only then, a Jedi will you be. And confront him you will.",6,213
Luke,Master Yoda... is Darth Vader my father?,6,214
Yoda,Mmm... rest I need. Yes... rest.,6,215
Luke,"Yoda, I must know.",6,216
Yoda,Your father he is.,6,217
Yoda,"Told you, did he?",6,218
Luke,Yes.,6,219
Yoda,"Unexpected this is, and unfortunate..",6,220
Luke,Unfortunate that I know the truth?,6,221
Yoda,No. Unfortunate that you rushed to face him... that incomplete was your training. Not ready for the burden were you.,6,222
Luke,"Well, I'm sorry.",6,223
Yoda,"Remember, a Jedi's strength flows from the Force.  But beware.  Anger, fear, aggression. The dark side are they.  Once you start down the dark path, forever will it dominate your destiny.",6,224
Yoda,"Luke...Luke...Do not...Do not underestimate the powers of the Emperor, or suffer your father's fate, you will. Luke, when gone am I , the last of the Jedi will you be. Luke, the Force runs strong in your family. Pass on what you have learned, Luke...  There is... another...Sky...Sky...walker.",6,225
Luke,"I can't do it, Artoo. I can't go on alone.",6,226
Ben,Yoda will always be with you.,6,227
Luke,Obi-Wan! Why didn't you tell me?,6,228
Luke,You told me Vader betrayed and murdered my father.,6,229
Ben,"You father was seduced by the dark side of the Force. He ceased to be Anakin Skywalker and became Darth Vader. When that happened, the good man who was your father was destroyed. So what I have told you was true... from a certain point of view.",6,230
Luke,A certain point of view!,6,231
Ben,"Luke, you're going to find that many of the truths we cling to depend greatly on our own point of view.",6,232
Ben,"I don't blame you for being angry. If I was wrong in what I did, it certainly wouldn't have been for the first time. You see, what happened to your father was my fault.",6,233
Ben,Anakin was a good friend.,6,234
Ben,"When I first knew him, your father was already a great pilot. But I was amazed how strongly the Force was with him.  I took it upon myself to train him as a Jedi.  I thought that I could instruct him just as well as Yoda.  I was wrong.  My pride has had terrible consequences for the galaxy.",6,235
Luke,There's still good in him.,6,236
Ben,I also thought he could be turned back to the good side. It couldn't be done. He is more machine now than man. Twisted and evil.,6,237
Luke,"I can't do it, Ben.",6,238
Ben,You cannot escape your destiny.,6,239
Luke,I tried to stop him once. I couldn't do it.,6,240
Ben,"Vader humbled you when first you met him, Luke...but that experience was part of your training. It taught you, among other things, the value of patience.  Had you not been so impatient to defeat Vader then, you could have finished your training here with Yoda. You would have been prepared.",6,241
Luke,But I had to help my friends.,6,242
Ben,"And did you help them? It was they who had to save you. You achieved little by rushing back prematurely, I fear.",6,243
Luke,I found out Darth Vader was my father.,6,244
Ben,"To be a Jedi, Luke, you must confront and then go beyond the dark side - the side your father couldn't get past. Impatience is the easiest door - for you, like your father. Only, your father was seduced by what he found on the other side of the door, and you have held firm. You're no longer so reckless now, Luke. You are strong and patient. And now, you must face Darth Vader again!",6,245
Luke,I can't kill my own father.,6,246
Ben,Then the Emperor has already won. You were our only hope.,6,247
Luke,Yoda spoke of another.,6,248
Ben,The other he spoke of is your twin sister.,6,249
Luke,But I have no sister.,6,250
Ben,"Hmm. To protect you both from the Emperor, you were hidden from your father when you were born. The Emperor knew, as I did, if Anakin were to have any offspring, they would be a threat to him. That is the reason why your sister remains safely anonymous.",6,251
Luke,Leia! Leia's my sister.,6,252
Ben,"Your insight serves you well. Bury your feelings deep down, Luke. They do you credit. But they could be made to serve the Emperor.",6,253
Ben,"When your father left, he didn't know your mother was pregnant. Your mother and I knew he would find out eventually, but we wanted to keep you both as safe as possible, for as long as possible.  So I took you to live with my brother Owen on Tatooine... and your mother took Leia to live as the daughter of Senator Organa, on Alderaan.",6,254
Ben,"The Organa household was high-born and politically quite powerful in that system. Leia became a princess by virtue of lineage... no one knew she'd been adopted, of course. But it was a title without real power, since Alderaan had long been a democracy.  Even so, the family continued to be politically powerful, and Leia, following in her foster father's path, became a senator as well.  That's not all she became, of course... she became the leader of her cell in the Alliance against the corrupt Empire. And because she had diplomatic immunity, she was a vital link for getting information to the Rebel cause.  That's what she was doing when her path crossed yours... for her foster parents had always told her to contact me on Tatooine, if her troubles became desperate.",6,255
Luke,"But you can't let her get involved now, Ben. Vader will destroy her.",6,256
Ben,"She hasn't been trained in the ways of the Jedi the way you have, Luke ... but the Force is strong with her, as it is with all of your family. There is no avoiding the battle. You must face and destroy Vader!",6,257
Han,"Well, look at you, a general, huh?",6,258
Lando,"Oh, well, someone must have told them about my little maneuver at the battle of Taanab.",6,259
Han,"Well, don't look at me, pal. I just said you were a fair pilot. I didn't know they were lookin' for somebody to lead this crazy attack.",6,260
Lando,I'm surprised they didn't ask you to do it.,6,261
Han,"Well, who says they didn't.  But I ain't crazy. You're the respectable one, remember?",6,262
Mon Mothma,The Emperor has made a critical error and the time for our attack has come.,6,263
Mon Mothma,"The data brought to us by the Bothan spies pinpoints the exact location of the Emperor's new battle station. We also know that the weapon systems of this Death Star are not yet operational. With the Imperial Fleet spread throughout the galaxy in a vain effort to engage us, it is relatively unprotected. But most important of all, we've learned that the Emperor himself is personally overseeing the final stages of the construction of this Death Star.",6,264
Mon Mothma,"Many Bothans died to bring us this information. Admiral Ackbar, please.",6,265
Ackbar,"You can see here the Death Star orbiting the forest Moon of Endor. Although the weapon systems on this Death Star are not yet operational, the Death Star does have a strong defense mechanism. It is protected by an energy shield, which is generated from the nearby forest Moon of Endor. The shield must be deactivated if any attack is to be attempted. Once the shield is down, our cruisers will create a perimeter, while the fighters fly into the superstructure and attempt to knock out the main reactor.",6,266
Ackbar,General Calrissian has volunteered to lead the fighter attack,6,267
Han,Good luck.,6,268
Han,You're gonna need it.,6,269
Ackbar,General Madine.,6,270
General Madine,"We have stolen a small Imperial shuttle. Disguised as a cargo ship, and using a secret Imperial code, a strike team will land on the moon and deactivate the shield generator.",6,271
Threepio,Sounds dangerous.,6,272
Leia,I wonder who they found to pull that off.,6,273
General Madine,"General Solo, is your strike team assembled?",6,274
Han,"Uh, my team's ready. I don't have a command crew for the shuttle.",6,275
Han,"Well, it's gonna be rough, pal. I didn't want to speak for you.",6,276
Han,That's one.,6,277
Leia,"Uh, General... count me in.",6,278
Voice,"I'm with you, too!",6,279
Leia,What is it?,6,280
Luke,Ask me again sometime.,6,281
Han,Luke.,6,282
Luke,"Hi, Han... Chewie.",6,283
Threepio,"""Exciting"" is hardly the word I would use.",6,284
Han,Look. I want you to take her. I mean it. Take her. You need all the help you can get. She's the fastest ship in the fleet.,6,285
Lando,"All right, old buddy. You know, I know what she means to you. I'll take good care of her. She-she won't get a scratch. All right?",6,286
Han,Right. I got your promise now. Not a scratch.,6,287
Lando,"Look, would you get going, you pirate.",6,288
Lando,Good luck.,6,289
Han,"You, too.",6,290
Han,You got her warmed?,6,291
Luke,"Yeah, she's comin' up.",6,292
Han,"No. I don't think the Empire had Wookiees in mind when they designed her, Chewie.",6,293
Leia,"Hey, are you awake?",6,294
Han,"Yeah, I just got a funny feeling. Like I'm not gonna see her again.",6,295
Leia,"Come on, General, let's move.",6,296
Han,"Right. Chewie, let's see what this piece of junk can do. Ready, everybody?",6,297
Luke,All set.,6,298
Threepio,Here we go again.,6,299
Han,"All right, hang on.",6,300
Vader,"What is thy bidding, my Master?",6,301
Emperor,Send the fleet to the far side of Endor. There it will stay until called for.,6,302
Vader,What of the reports of the Rebel fleet massing near Sullust?,6,303
Emperor,"It is of no concern. Soon the Rebellion will be crushed and young Skywalker will be one of us! Your work here is finished, my friend. Go out to the command ship and await my orders.",6,304
Vader,"Yes, my Master.",6,305
Han,"If they don't go for this, we're gonna have to get outta here pretty quick, Chewie.",6,306
Controller,We have you on our screen now. Please identify.,6,307
Han,Shuttle Tydirium requesting deactivation of the deflector shield.,6,308
Controller,"Shuttle Tydirium, transmit the clearance code for shield passage.",6,309
Han,Transmission commencing.,6,310
Leia,Now we find out if that code is worth the price we paid.,6,311
Han,It'll work. It'll work.,6,312
Luke,Vader's on that ship.,6,313
Han,"Now don't get jittery, Luke. There are a lot of command ships. Keep your distance though, Chewie, but don't look like you're trying to keep your distance.",6,314
Han,I don't know.  Fly casual.,6,315
Luke,I'm endangering the mission. I shouldn't have come.,6,316
Han,"It's your imagination, kid. Come on. Let's keep a little optimism here.",6,317
Vader,Where is that shuttle going?,6,318
Piett,"Shuttle Tydirium, what is your cargo and destination?",6,319
Pilot Voice,Parts and technical crew for the forest moon.,6,320
Vader,Do they have a code clearance?,6,321
Piett,"It's an older code, sir, but it checks out. I was about to clear them.",6,322
Piett,Shall I hold them?,6,323
Vader,No. Leave them to me. I will deal with them myself.,6,324
Piett,"As you wish, my lord.  Carry on.",6,325
Han,"They're not goin' for it, Chewie.",6,326
Controller,"Shuttle Tydirium, deactivation of the shield will commence immediately. Follow your present course.",6,327
Han,Okay! I told you it was gonna work. No problem.,6,328
Threepio,"Oh, I told you it was dangerous here.",6,329
Leia,Shall we try and go around?,6,330
Han,It'll take time. This whole party'll be for nothing if they see us.,6,331
Han,Chewie and I will take care of this. You stay here.,6,332
Luke,"Quietly, there might be more of them out there.",6,333
Han,Hey... it's me.,6,334
Scout #1,Go for help! Go!,6,335
Luke,Great. Come on.,6,336
Leia,Over there! Two more of them!,6,337
Luke,"I see them. Wait, Leia!",6,338
Luke,Quick! Jam their comlink. Center switch!,6,339
Han,"Hey, wait! Ahhh!",6,340
Luke,Move closer!,6,341
Luke,Get alongside that one!,6,342
Luke,Get him!,6,343
Luke,Keep on that one! I'll take these two!,6,344
Threepio,"Oh, General Solo, somebody's coming. Oh!",6,345
Han,Luke! Where's Leia?,6,346
Luke,What? She didn't come back?,6,347
Han,I thought she was with you.,6,348
Luke,We got separated.,6,349
Luke,"Hey, we better go look for her.",6,350
Han,Take the squad ahead.  We'll meet at the shield generator at 0300.,6,351
Luke,"Come on, Artoo.  We'll need your scanners.",6,352
Threepio,"Don't worry, Master Luke.  We know what to do.",6,353
Threepio,And you said it was pretty here. Ugh!,6,354
Leia,Cut it out!,6,355
Leia,I'm not gonna hurt you.,6,356
Leia,"Well, looks like I'm stuck here. Trouble is, I don't know where here is.",6,357
Leia,"Well, maybe you can help me. Come on, sit down.",6,358
Leia,I promise I won't hurt you. Now come here.,6,359
Leia,All right. You want something to eat?,6,360
Leia,That's right. Come on. Hmmm?,6,361
Leia,"Look, it's a hat. It's not gonna hurt you. Look. You're a jittery little thing, aren't you?",6,362
Leia,What is it?,6,363
Scout #L,"Freeze!  Come on, get up!",6,364
Scout #1,Go get your ride and take her back to base.,6,365
Scout #2,"Yes, sir.",6,366
Leia,"Come on, let's get outta here.",6,367
Guard,Halt! The Emperor does not wish to be disturbed at the moment.,6,368
Vader,"The Emperor will see me, now!",6,369
Guard,"The Emperor will see you, now.",6,370
Emperor,I told you to remain on the command ship.,6,371
Vader,A small Rebel force has penetrated the shield and landed on Endor.,6,372
Emperor,"Yes, I know.",6,373
Vader,My son is with them.,6,374
Emperor,Are you sure?,6,375
Vader,"I have felt him, my Master.",6,376
Emperor,"Strange, that I have not. I wonder if your feelings on this matter are clear, Lord Vader.",6,377
Vader,"They are clear, my Master.",6,378
Emperor,Then you must go to the Sanctuary Moon and wait for them.,6,379
Vader,He will come to me?,6,380
Emperor,I have foreseen it. His compassion for you will be his undoing. He will come to you and then you will bring him before me.,6,381
Vader,As you wish.,6,382
Han,Luke! Luke!,6,383
Threepio,"Oh, Master Luke.",6,384
Luke,There's two more wrecked speeders back there. And I found this.,6,385
Threepio,I'm afraid that Artoo's sensors can find no trace of Princess Leia.,6,386
Han,I hope she's alright.,6,387
Han,"What, Chewie? What? Chewie!",6,388
Han,"Hey, I don't get it.",6,389
Han,"Nah, it's just a dead animal, Chewie.",6,390
Luke,"Chewie, wa-wait!  Don't!",6,391
Han,"Nice work. Great, Chewie! Great! Always thinking with your stomach.",6,392
Luke,"Will you take it easy? Let's just figure out a way to get out of this thing.  Han, can you reach my lightsaber?",6,393
Han,"Yeah, sure.",6,394
Threepio,"Artoo, I'm not sure that's such a good idea. It's a very long dro-o-op!!",6,395
Han,Wha--?  Hey!  Point that thing someplace else.,6,396
Han,Hey!,6,397
Luke,"Han, don't. It'll be all right.",6,398
Luke,"Chewie, give 'em your crossbow.",6,399
Threepio,"Oh, my head. Oh, my goodness!",6,400
Luke,Do you understand anything they're saying?,6,401
Threepio,"Oh, yes, Master Luke!  Remember that I am fluent in over six million forms of communication.",6,402
Han,What are you telling them?,6,403
Threepio,"Hello, I think... I could be mistaken. They're using a very primitive dialect.  But I do believe they think I am some sort of god.",6,404
Han,"Well, why don't you use your divine influence and get us out of this?",6,405
Threepio,"I beg your pardon, General Solo, but that just wouldn't be proper.",6,406
Han,Proper?!,6,407
Threepio,It's against my programming to impersonate a deity.,6,408
Han,"Why, you--",6,409
Han,My mistake. He's an old friend of mine.,6,410
Han,I have a really bad feeling about this.,6,411
Han,What did he say?,6,412
Threepio,"I'm rather embarrassed, General Solo, but it appears you are to be the main course at a banquet in my honor.",6,413
Han And Luke,Leia!,6,414
Leia,Oh!,6,415
Threepio,Your Royal Highness.,6,416
Leia,"But these are my friends. Threepio, tell them they must be set free.",6,417
Han,"Somehow, I got the feeling that didn't help us very much.",6,418
Luke,"Threepio, tell them if they don't do as you wish, you'll become angry and use your magic.",6,419
Threepio,"But Master Luke, what magic? couldn't possibly --",6,420
Luke,Just tell them.,6,421
Threepio,"You see, Master Luke; they didn't believe me. Just...",6,422
Threepio,"... as I said they wouldn't. Wha-wha-what's happening! Oh! Oh, dear! Oh!",6,423
Threepio,"Put me down! He-e-elp! Master Luke! Artoo! Somebody, somebody, help! Master Luke, Artoo! Artoo, quickly! Do something, somebody! Oh! Ohhh!",6,424
Threepio,"Oh, oh, oh, oh! Thank goodness.",6,425
Luke,"Thanks, Threepio.",6,426
Threepio,I...I never knew I had it in me.,6,427
Threepio,"Yes, Artoo. I was just coming to that.",6,428
Han,What's going on?,6,429
Leia,I don't know.,6,430
Threepio,Wonderful! We are now a part of the tribe.,6,431
Han,Just what I always wanted.,6,432
Han,"Well, short help is better than no help at all, Chewie.  Thank you. Okay.",6,433
Threepio,He says the scouts are going to show us the quickest way to the shield generator.,6,434
Han,"Good. How far is it? Ask him. We need some fresh supplies, too. And try and get our weapons back.",6,435
Han,"And hurry up, will ya? I haven't got all day.",6,436
Luke,"Luke, what's wrong?",6,437
Luke,Leia... do you remember your mother? Your real mother?,6,438
Leia,Just a little bit. She died when I was very young.,6,439
Luke,What do you remember?,6,440
Leia,"Just...images, really. Feelings.",6,441
Luke,Tell me.,6,442
Leia,"She was very beautiful. Kind, but...sad.  Why are you asking me all this?",6,443
Luke,I have no memory of my mother. I never knew her.,6,444
Leia,"Luke, tell me. What's troubling you?",6,445
Luke,"Vader is here...now, on this moon.",6,446
Leia,How do you know?,6,447
Luke,"I felt his presence. He's come for me. He can feel when I'm near. That's why I have to go.  As long as I stay, I'm endangering the group and our mission here.  I have to face him.",6,448
Leia,Why?,6,449
Luke,He's my father.,6,450
Leia,Your father?,6,451
Luke,"There's more. It won't be easy for you to hear it, but you must. If I don't make it back, you're the only hope for the Alliance.",6,452
Leia,"Luke, don't talk that way. You have a power I--I don't understand and could never have.",6,453
Luke,"You're wrong, Leia. You have that power too. In time you'll learn to use it as I have. The Force is strong in my family. My father has it...I have it...and...my sister has it.",6,454
Luke,Yes. It's you Leia.,6,455
Leia,I know. Somehow...I've always known.,6,456
Luke,Then you know why I have to face him.,6,457
Leia,"No! Luke, run away, far away. If he can feel your presence, then leave this place. I wish I could go with you.",6,458
Luke,"No, you don't. You've always been strong.",6,459
Leia,"But, why must you confront him?",6,460
Luke,Because...there is good in him. I've felt it. He won't turn me over to the Emperor. I can save him. I can turn him back to the good side. I have to try.,6,461
Han,"Hey, what's goin' on?",6,462
Leia,Nothing. I - just want to be alone for a little while.,6,463
Han,"Nothing?  Come on, tell me.  What's goin' on?",6,464
Leia,I...I can't tell you.,6,465
Han,Did you tell Luke? Is that who you could tell?,6,466
Leia,I...,6,467
Han,Ahhh...,6,468
Han,I'm sorry.,6,469
Leia,Hold me.,6,470
Commander,"This is a Rebel that surrendered to us. Although he denies it, I believe there may be more of them, and I request permission to conduct a further search of the area.",6,471
Commander,He was armed only with this.,6,472
Vader,"Good work, Commander. Leave us. Conduct your search and bring his companions to me.",6,473
Commander,"Yes, my Lord.",6,474
Vader,The Emperor has been expecting you.,6,475
Luke,"I know, father.",6,476
Vader,"So, you have accepted the truth.",6,477
Luke,"I've accepted the truth that you were once Anakin Skywalker, my father.",6,478
Vader,That name no longer has any meaning for me.,6,479
Luke,It is the name of your true self. You've only forgotten. I know there is good in you. The Emperor hasn't driven it from you fully. That is why you couldn't destroy me. That's why you won't bring me to your Emperor now.,6,480
Vader,I see you have constructed a new lightsaber.,6,481
Vader,"Your skills are complete. Indeed, you are powerful, as the Emperor has foreseen.",6,482
Luke,Come with me.,6,483
Vader,Obi-Wan once thought as you do.,6,484
Vader,You don't know the power of the dark side. I must obey my master.,6,485
Luke,I will not turn...and you'll be forced to kill me.,6,486
Vader,If that is your destiny.,6,487
Luke,"Search your feelings, father. You can't do this. I feel the conflict within you. Let go of your hate.",6,488
Vader,"It is too late for me, son. The Emperor will show you the true nature of the Force. He is your master now.",6,489
Luke,Then my father is truly dead.,6,490
Leia,The main entrance to the control bunker's on the far side of that landing platform. This isn't gonna be easy.,6,491
Han,"Hey, don't worry. Chewie and me got into a lot of places more heavily guarded than this.",6,492
Leia,What's he saying?,6,493
Threepio,He says there's a secret entrance on the other side of the ridge.,6,494
Lando,"Admiral, we're in position. All fighters accounted for.",6,495
Ackbar,Proceed with the countdown. All groups assume attack coordinates.,6,496
Lando,"Don't worry, my friends are down there. They'll have that shield down on time... or this'll be the shortest offensive of all time.",6,497
Ackbar,"All craft, prepare to jump to hyperspace on my mark.",6,498
Lando,All right. Stand by.,6,499
Han,"Back door, huh? Good idea.",6,500
Han,It's only a few guards. This shouldn't be too much trouble.,6,501
Leia,"Well, it only takes one to sound the alarm.",6,502
Han,Then we'll do it real quiet-like.,6,503
Threepio,"Oh! Oh, my. Uh, Princess Leia!",6,504
Leia,Quiet.,6,505
Threepio,I'm afraid our furry companion has gone and done something rather rash.,6,506
Leia,"Oh, no.",6,507
Han,There goes our surprise attack.,6,508
Scout,Look! Over there! Stop him!,6,509
Han,Not bad for a little furball. There's only one left. You stay here. We'll take care of this.,6,510
Threepio,I have decided that we shall stay here.,6,511
Emperor,"Welcome, young Skywalker. I have been expecting you.",6,512
Emperor,You no longer need those.,6,513
Emperor,"Guards, leave us.",6,514
Emperor,I'm looking forward to completing your training. In time you will call me Master.,6,515
Luke,You're gravely mistaken. You won't convert me as you did my father.,6,516
Emperor,"Oh, no, my young Jedi. You will find that it is you who are mistaken...about a great many things.",6,517
Vader,His lightsaber.,6,518
Emperor,"Ah, yes, a Jedi's weapon. Much like your father's. By now you must know your father can never be turned from the dark side. So will it be with you.",6,519
Luke,You're wrong. Soon I'll be dead...and you with me.,6,520
Emperor,Perhaps you refer to the imminent attack of your Rebel fleet.,6,521
Emperor,Yes...I assure you we are quite safe from your friends here.,6,522
Luke,Your overconfidence is your weakness.,6,523
Emperor,Your faith in your friends is yours.,6,524
Vader,"It is pointless to resist, my son.",6,525
Emperor,Everything that has transpired has done so according to my design.  Your friends up there on the Sanctuary Moon...,6,526
Emperor,...are walking into a trap. As is your Rebel fleet! It was I who allowed the Alliance to know the location of the shield generator. It is quite safe from your pitiful little band. An entire legion of my best troops awaits them.,6,527
Emperor,Oh...I'm afraid the deflector shield will be quite operational when your friends arrive.,6,528
Han,"All right! Up! Move! Come on! Quickly! Quickly, Chewie.",6,529
Leia,Han! Hurry! The fleet will be here any moment.,6,530
Han,"Charges!  Come on, come on!",6,531
Threepio,"Oh, my! They'll be captured!",6,532
Threepio,"Wa-wait! Wait, come back! Artoo, stay with me.",6,533
Commander,Freeze! You Rebel scum.,6,534
Lando,All wings report in.,6,535
Wedge,Red Leader standing by.,6,536
Gray Leader,Gray Leader standing by.,6,537
Green Leader,Green Leader standing by.,6,538
Wedge,Lock S-foils in attack positions.,6,539
Ackbar,May the Force be with us.,6,540
Lando,"We've got to be able to get some kind of a reading on that shield, up or down. Well, how could they be jamming us if they don't know if we're coming.",6,541
Lando,Break off the attack! The shield is still up.,6,542
Red Leader,I get no reading. Are you sure?,6,543
Lando,Pull up! All craft pull up!,6,544
Ackbar,"Take evasive action! Green Group, stick close to holding sector MV-7.",6,545
Controller,"Admiral, we have enemy ships in sector 47.",6,546
Ackbar,It's a trap!,6,547
Lando,Fighters coming in.,6,548
Rebel Pilot,There's too many of them!,6,549
Lando,Accelerate to attack speed! Draw their fire away from the cruisers.,6,550
Wedge,"Copy, Gold Leader.",6,551
Emperor,"Come, boy. See for yourself.",6,552
Emperor,"From here you will witness the final destruction of the Alliance, and the end of your insignificant Rebellion.",6,553
Emperor,"You want this, don't you? The hate is swelling in you now. Take your Jedi weapon. Use it. I am unarmed. Strike me down with it. Give in to your anger. With each passing moment, you make yourself more my servant.",6,554
Luke,No!,6,555
Emperor,"It is unavoidable. It is your destiny. You, like your father, are now mine!",6,556
Stormtrooper,"All right, move it! I said move it! Go on!",6,557
Threepio,"Hello! I say, over there! Were you looking for me?",6,558
Bunker Commander,Bring those two down here!,6,559
Stormtrooper,Let's go!,6,560
Threepio,"Well, they're on their way. Artoo, are you sure this was a good idea?",6,561
Stormtrooper,Freeze! Don't move!,6,562
Threepio,We surrender.,6,563
Threepio,"Ohhh! Stand back, Artoo.",6,564
Leia,The code's changed. We need Artoo!,6,565
Han,Here's the terminal.,6,566
Leia,"Artoo, where are you? We need you at the bunker right away.",6,567
Threepio,"Going? What do you mean, you're going. But-- but going where, Artoo? No, what! Artoo! Oh, this is no time for heroics. Come back!",6,568
Lando,"Watch yourself, Wedge! Three from above!",6,569
Wedge,"Red Three, Red Two, pull in!",6,570
Red Two,Got it!,6,571
Red Three,"Three of them coming in, twenty degrees!",6,572
Wedge,Cut to the left! I'll take the leader! They're heading for the medical frigate.,6,573
Navigator,Pressure's steady.,6,574
Lando,Only the fighters are attacking.  I wonder what those Star Destroyers are waiting for.,6,575
Commander,"We're in attack position now, sir.",6,576
Piett,Hold here.,6,577
Commander,We're not going to attack?,6,578
Piett,I have my orders from the Emperor himself. He has something special planned for them. We only need to keep them from escaping.,6,579
Emperor,"As you can see, my young apprentice, your friends have failed. Now witness the firepower of this fully armed and operational battle station.  Fire at will, Commander.",6,580
Jerjerrod,Fire!,6,581
Lando,"That blast came from the Death Star! That thing's operational!  Home One, this is Gold Leader.",6,582
Ackbar,We saw it. All craft prepare to retreat.,6,583
Lando,"You won't get another chance at this, Admiral.",6,584
Ackbar,"We have no choice, General Calrissian. Our cruisers can't repel firepower of that magnitude.",6,585
Lando,Han will have that shield down. We've got to give him more time.,6,586
Threepio,We're coming!,6,587
Han,Come on! Come on!,6,588
Threepio,"Oh, Artoo, hurry!",6,589
Threepio,"My goodness! Artoo, why did you have to be so brave?",6,590
Han,"Well, I suppose I could hotwire this thing.",6,591
Leia,I'll cover you.,6,592
Lando,Yes! I said closer! Move as close as you can and engage those Star Destroyers at point- blank range.,6,593
Ackbar,"At that close range, we won't last long against those Star Destroyers.",6,594
Lando,We'll last longer then we will against that Death Star...and we might just take a few of them with us.,6,595
Rebel Pilot,She's gonna blow!,6,596
Y-Wing Pilot,I'm hit!,6,597
Emperor,"Your fleet has lost. And your friends on the Endor moon will not survive. There is no escape, my young apprentice. The Alliance will die...as will your friends.",6,598
Emperor,"Good. I can feel your anger. I am defenseless.  Take your weapon! Strike me down with all your hatred, and your journey towards the dark side will be complete.",6,599
Walker Pilot #1,Look!,6,600
Pilot #2,Get him off of there!,6,601
Han,I think I got it. I got it!,6,602
Threepio,"Oh, Princess Leia, are you all right?",6,603
Han,Let's see.,6,604
Leia,It's not bad.,6,605
Stormtrooper,Freeze!,6,606
Threepio,"Oh, dear.",6,607
Stormtrooper,Don't move!,6,608
Han,I love you.,6,609
Leia,I know.,6,610
Stormtrooper,Hands up! Stand up!,6,611
Han,Stay back.,6,612
Han,"Chewie!  Get down here!  She's wounded!  No, wait....  I got an idea.",6,613
Emperor,"Good.  Use your aggressive feelings, boy!  Let the hate flow through you.",6,614
Vader,Obi-Wan has taught you well.,6,615
Luke,"I will not fight you, father.",6,616
Vader,You are unwise to lower your defenses.,6,617
Luke,"Your thoughts betray you, father. I feel the good in you...the conflict.",6,618
Vader,There is no conflict.,6,619
Luke,"You couldn't bring yourself to kill me before, and I don't believe you'll destroy me now.",6,620
Vader,"You underestimate the power of the dark side. If you will not fight, then you will meet your destiny.",6,621
Emperor,Good.  Good.,6,622
Lando,Watch out. Squad at .06.,6,623
Rebel Pilot,"I'm on it, Gold Leader.",6,624
Wedge,"Good shot, Red Two.",6,625
Lando,"Now...come on, Han, old buddy. Don't let me down.",6,626
Han/Pilot,"It's over, Commander. The Rebels have been routed. They're fleeing into the woods. We need reinforcements to continue the pursuit.",6,627
Control Room Commander,Send three squads to help. Open the back door.,6,628
Second Commander,"Yes, sir.",6,629
Han,Throw me another charge.,6,630
Vader,"You cannot hide forever, Luke.",6,631
Luke,I will not fight you.,6,632
Vader,"Give yourself to the dark side. It is the only way you can save your friends. Yes, your thoughts betray you. Your feelings for them are strong. Especially for...",6,633
Vader,"Sister! So...you have a twin sister. Your feelings have now betrayed her, too. Obi-Wan was wise to hide her from me. Now his failure is complete. If you will not turn to the dark side, then perhaps she will.",6,634
Luke,Never-r-r!,6,635
Emperor,"Good! Your hate has made you powerful. Now, fulfill your destiny and take your father's place at my side!",6,636
Luke,"Never! I'll never turn to the dark side. You've failed, Your Highness. I am a Jedi, like my father before me.",6,637
Emperor,So be it...Jedi.,6,638
Han,Move! Move!,6,639
Ackbar,The shield is down! Commence attack on the Death Star's main reactor.,6,640
Lando,"We're on our way. Red Group, Gold Group, all fighters follow me.  Told you they'd do it!",6,641
Emperor,"If you will not be turned, you will be destroyed.",6,642
Emperor,"Young fool...only now, at the end, do you understand.",6,643
Emperor,Your feeble skills are no match for the power of the dark side. You have paid the price for your lack of vision.,6,644
Luke,"Father, please. Help me.",6,645
Emperor,"Now, young Skywalker...you will die.",6,646
Wedge,I'm going in.,6,647
Lando,Here goes nothing.,6,648
Lando,Now lock onto the strongest power source. It should be the power generator.,6,649
Wedge,Form up. And stay alert. We could run out of space real fast.,6,650
Lando,Split up and head back to the surface. See if you can get a few of those TIE fighters to follow you.,6,651
Pilot,"Copy, Gold Leader.",6,652
Lando,That was too close.,6,653
Ackbar,We've got to give those fighters more time. Concentrate all fire on that Super Star Destroyer.,6,654
Controller,"Sir, we've lost our bridge deflector shield.",6,655
Piett,Intensify the forward batteries. I don't want anything to get through.,6,656
Piett,Intensify forward firepower!,6,657
Commander,It's too late!,6,658
Vader,"Luke, help me take this mask off.",6,659
Lure,But you'll die.,6,660
Vader,Nothing can stop that now. Just for once... let me look on you with my own eyes.,6,661
Anakin,"Now...go, my son. Leave me.",6,662
Luke,No. You're coming with me. I can't leave you here. I've got to save you.,6,663
Anakin,"You already have, Luke. You were right about me. Tell your sister...you were right.",6,664
Luke,Father... I won't leave you.,6,665
Wedge,There it is!,6,666
Lando,"All right, Wedge. Go for the power regulator on the north tower.",6,667
Wedge,"Copy, Gold Leader. I'm already on my way out.",6,668
Ackbar,Move the fleet away from the Death Star.,6,669
Lando,"Wedge, I don't think we're going to make it.",6,670
Wedge,You'll make it. Just follow me Gold Leader.,6,671
Lando,I promised to return his ship without a scratch...I sure hope that old pirate forgives me.,6,672
Han,Lando...,6,673
Threepio,They did it!,6,674
